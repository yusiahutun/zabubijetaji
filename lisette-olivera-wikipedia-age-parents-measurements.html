Her character, Jess is a Mexican-American DREAMer who was grieving her mother’s death after she received a clue about a centuries-old treasure in the form of a family heirloom necklace.</span></p><p><span>However, Jess wasn’t the only one interested in locking the secrets of her past. There was a black-market antiquities dealer Billie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who was in search of the prize as well.</span></p><p><span>On the show, Jess’s dad gets killed as well in an attempt to prevent thieves from finding the location of an Aztec Empire relic. He was double-crossed by a mysterious boss — which was also the main reason why her mother fled to the US from Mexico!</span></p><p><span>Promoting the show, Lisette took to her IG to write, “Grab your torches and let the countdown begin. National Treasure: Edge of History premieres in less than one month. Are you ready for the adventure?”</span></p><p><span>She was both nervous and excited to be the new face of a franchise. And it’s understandable given how closely associated the National Treasure films are with their leading man, Nicolas Cage. Replacing him certainly is no easy feat!</span></p><p><span>In case you’re wondering, Nicolas couldn’t make it to the first season of the show as his schedule got in the way. But worry not for co-showrunner Marianne Wibberley promised to bring him back in an episode if they got a second season.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> Lisette broke out into tears when a key character faced a tragic death in </span><i><span>National Treasure: Book of Secrets</span></i><span> (season 2). “I was so angry and said to my parents, ‘I can’t believe the writers did that,” she explained.</span></p><h3><b>Lisette Olivera Movies And TV Shows</b></h3><p><span>Lisette Olivera is an up-and-coming actress.
