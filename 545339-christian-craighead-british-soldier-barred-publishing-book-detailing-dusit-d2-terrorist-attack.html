For reasons I don’t personally and professionally agree with, the MOD and the courts have decided that this book cannot be published in its current form," Craighead disclosed.<h2>Why was Christian Craighead's book gagged?</h2><p class=align-left>This prohibition stems from an October 2023 ruling by British Justice Steyn, who cited regulations that prevent military personnel from releasing information that could potentially endanger national <a href=#>security</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/422b80be537d172d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review, April 17: Equity Bank Heist Sees Customers Lose KSh 290m</span></p></a>"He has only been prevented from giving an account of an operation, the Dusit incident, in which he engaged as a member of UK special forces,” Justice Steyn said during a private hearing.<p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the Telegraph</a>, the judge also considered the implications for all parties connected to the Dusit incident, including the victims and the UK Special Air Service (SAS).</p>“Those community interests entail the protection of lives, the protection of national security, the maintenance of the morale and efficiency of UKSF and protecting relations with defence partners."“On the evidence before me, the interests of the community substantially outweigh the claimant's interest in publishing a memoir about the Dusit incident (even when buttressed by the interest of the public in receiving the information he wishes to disclose, and by the interest of his publisher)," Steyn added.<p class=align-left>Craighead had hoped to challenge the decision but was ultimately denied the opportunity to appeal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ed3161670dc5aca3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review, April 16: Sorrow as Girl, 6, Drowns in Swimming Pool</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The UK has stringent policies against Special Forces members who publicly discuss their operations or profit from them.</p><p class=align-left>Nonetheless, Craighead maintains that his memoir is a personal narrative of the Dusit attack and poses no threat to national security.</p><p class=align-left>He voiced his frustration over the restriction, eager to reveal the true extent and intensity of his involvement in the rescue operation.</p>"As a point of note, the book focused on thce January 2019 incident in Kenya and not on my career in 22 SAS. The story about that day in Kenya is not going away. I’m sure we will continue to see more videos and documentaries appearing on YouTube and other media platforms. However, a source of frustration to me is that I and others know the real story, and my role in it is much more brutal than what people think happened," he concluded.<h2>What was Christian Craighead's role in Dusit attack?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/110cd6fec4a389ee.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rongo School Threatens to Sue Media House Over Story Linking it to Deadly Cult</span></p></a><p class=align-left>During the Dusit attack, Craighead and other SAS soldiers were in Kenya training local soldiers.</p><p class=align-left>Although he was off-duty that day, he swiftly responded to the emergency.</p><p class=align-left>He arrived at the scene armed with a Colt Canada C8 rifle, a Glock 17 pistol, and a combat knife.</p><p class=align-left>The seasoned soldier, who has served in several war-torn areas such as Afghanistan, charged into the building and ultimately rescued several people while also neutralising the terrorists.</p><h2>Al-Shabaab militants hit by IED they were planting</h2><p class=align-left>In another story, two al-Shabaab militants died after <a href=#>being hit by an Improvised Explosive Device (IED)</a> they were planting along a road in <a href=#>Garissa County</a>.</p><p class=align-left>In a statement seen by <strong>TUKO.co.ke</strong>, the <a href=#>Directorate of Criminal Investigations</a> (DCI) said the IED exploded, killing two of them on the spot, as others scattered from the scene with life-threatening injuries.</p><p class=align-left>Police found a battery and some wires at the scene, believed to have been part of the explosive.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnC8xKinpZ1faoF2f5JyZJygop7AtbXAp2ScqpGetKmxwJ1km6qZqba0tIyspqWcmZq%2Fbq7Aq6menF2lwqO4yKyfoqaXYq%2Bwu8pmm56skZ65qrrGZpuuq5mpeqV%2BjK2cq6qfp7a0wIyaq62Zk6B8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./julio-jones-girlfriend-married-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Julio Jones Girlfriend, Wife, Married</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amy-robach-tj-holmes-shocking-bonus-new-podcast.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amy Robach and TJ Holmes receive shocking bonus ahead of new podcast</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
