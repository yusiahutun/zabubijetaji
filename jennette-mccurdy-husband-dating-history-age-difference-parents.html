The actress has kept a low profile when it comes to her personal life and rarely discusses her romantic status in public.</span></p><p><span>McCurdy was born on June 26, 1992, making her 30 in 2021. We do not yet know the age difference between her and her boyfriend because she has not mentioned him or her.</span></p><p><span>She is a well-known figure who successfully won the hearts of millions of people in the late 2000s through her performances. Even though Jennette has a large following, many other celebrities are interested in dating her, but she always keeps quiet about her romantic life.</span></p><p><span>[image-1]</span></p><p><span>Jennette was quite honest about her relationships in the past, but she wasn't very lucky because she dumped a lot of guys. She hasn't yet discovered the person she's looking for, but if she does, she'll be sure to let her admirers know.</span></p><p><span>The cast of Victorious McCurdy was one of Nickelodeon's most well-liked and well-known ensembles. Only very young children are unaware of Victorious, which brought us many amusing scenes and is still well-known even though the show ended decades ago.</span></p><p><span>Through her hilarious characters, for which she is still known and for which no one else can do better than her, she made the childhoods of many children in the 2000s fantastic.</span></p><h2 id=jennette-mccurdys-dating->Jennette McCurdy's Dating History</h2><p><span>Jennette McCurdy has dated many celebs throughout the years.

In 2010, he and Jannette appeared on the same episode of "iCarly." But they also broke up soon after.</span></p><p><span>After that, the actress dated Paul Glasner. Jennette was only 18 years old, and Paul was 31. Their differences in ages may have been the primary factor in their breakup.</span></p><p><span>She decided to date Andre Drummond, a former Brooklyn Nets player who played in the NBA. It was possibly her most well-known romance, but their breakup didn't go well as they criticized each other a lot.</span></p><p><span>Her last relationship in public was with Jesse Carere. Before McCurdy's sweet birthday greeting to Jesse in 2016, this pair had not been seen or heard from much. A brief romantic story ends with the pair choosing to separate.</span></p><h2 id=jennette-mccurdys-parents>Jennette McCurdy's parents are</h2><p><span>Jennette McCurdy was born to Debra McCurdy and Mark McCurdy.

While maintaining a cheery attitude toward the public in the intervening years, she performed a high-wire act of people-pleasing and quiet suffering.</span></p><p><span>[image-3]</span></p><p><span>Jennette was home-schooled with her three older brothers in a modest house in Orange County, California, and grew up relatively impoverished and Mormon.</span></p><p><span>Her mother pushed her unfulfilled dreams of becoming an actress upon her daughter. After her mother passed away, she learned that her father was not her real father.</span></p><p><span>Even when Jennette was a teenager, Debra dictated her preferences and made all her decisions. She was adamant about giving McCurdy showers up until the age of 16, shampooing her hair, shaving her legs, and performing regular vaginal and breast exams to look for malignant lumps, according to her.</span></p><p><span>Even though Jennette was very well-liked when she was a teenager, her mother frequently abused her.
