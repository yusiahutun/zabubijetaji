People were loving the adorable clip, as they took to the comments to respond.</p><p>“Hmmm wonder who’s been teaching him lol,” one fan joked. Another added, “This is ADORABLE! I miss when mine were still small.” Even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>David Beckham</strong></a> chimed in with, “Just like his dad!”</p><p>The&nbsp;Hell’s Kitchen star shares little Oscar and four other kids — Megan, 22; Holly and Jack, both 20; and Matilda, 18 – with his longtime wife, Tana Ramsay. The pair tied the knot in 1996. The TV chef is very open about his children, especially Oscar — he recently touched on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">day his fifth child was born</a>.</p><p>“I’ve been giddy flying in a fighter jet at 1,000mph. I’ve done some very dangerous things underwater. But I’ve never, ever felt as vulnerable as I did when my son Oscar was born,” Gordon previously told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>. “I’m sat there in the room worrying about menus and ingredients and all of a sudden this little head pops out the sun roof and you s–t yourself.”</p><p>“I cried my f–king eyes out,” he admitted to the outlet. “All of a sudden you are nobody. You’re standing there looking at a team of experts who are saying, ‘Right. We’re going to look after you now, Tana.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-30-at-2.22.23-PM.png><p>“I was as white as a ghost,” Gordon added. “I fell back into the chair and I fainted. They said, ‘Tana’s fine. I think it’s you we need to look after next. It was just a moment of madness, being out of control. I’m a control freak, always in control.” All that shows us is that Gordon is crazy about being a father.</p><p>We can’t wait to see what Oscar does next in his life!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46gpqucn6N6s63MrJiyq12ovK95zqyamqpdbXquu82tn6xlnJqus7rSZp%2Bor12pvG7DwKWiaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./362239-akshay-kumar-net-worth-2020-income-house-age-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Akshay Kumar net worth 2020: income, house, age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./418726-faze-kay-girlfriend-net-worth-crypto-scheme-nationality-faze-clan-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>FaZe Kay: girlfriend, net worth, crypto scheme, nationality, FaZe Clan</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
