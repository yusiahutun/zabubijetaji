And while speaking about writing and producing songs at a young age, she shares the inspiration behind "Bootylicious," a pop song that since its release has become a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a37308251/beyonce-self-care-journey-rejecting-diet-culture-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="body-positive anthem" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">body-positive anthem</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyoncé says that she actually wrote the song in response to the criticism she was receiving regarding her body. "I remember when I started hearing people criticize me after I had put on some weight. I was 19. None of the sample clothes fit me. I was feeling a bit insecure from hearing some of the comments, and I woke up one day and refused to feel sorry for myself, so I wrote 'Bootylicious,'" she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She adds, "It was the beginning of me using whatever life handed me and turning it into something empowering to other women and men who were struggling with the same thing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 39-year-old also shares that her father and former manager, Mathew Knowles, encouraged her to write her own songs and "create [her] own vision." Her parents played a big role her career, especially her mother, Tina Knowles-Lawson, in helping her establish a good work ethic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My mother has always been my Queen and still is. She has always been so strong and is filled with humanity. She worked 18 hours a day with calloused hands and swollen feet. No matter how tired she was, she was always professional, loving, and nurturing. I try to handle my work and run my company in the same way," Beyoncé says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for "Bootylicious," the empowering lyrics and iconic "Edge of Seventeen" sample makes it one of the best girl group songs in history. "Edge of Seventeen" singer Stevie Nicks spoke with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a34324168/stevie-nicks-bootylicious-video-destinys-child/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ELLE class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">ELLE</a> last year about her experience appearing in the "Bootylicious" video alongside Destiny's Child.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Without all the make-up and everything, they just looked like three really cute, little teenage girls," Nicks said of the group. "Then of course, they're just like me, they put on—whatever it is that makes them—them. Whether it's your boots or jacket or whatever, then they became Destiny's Child, and I saw it. It was really a marvel to see."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
