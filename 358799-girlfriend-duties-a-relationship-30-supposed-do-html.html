What is a girlfriend supposed to do in a relationship? As a girlfriend, you need to play your role by doing the following:</p><h3>1. Take care of him</h3><p class=align-left>The reality about <a href=#>relationships</a> is that it is not one person’s responsibility to take care of the other. It is a mutual or collective responsibility. Partners must do their best to take care of one another. What should a girlfriend do? Play your part by doing the following:</p><ul><li>Talking to him whenever he opens up because it shows you are listening and caring</li><li>Indulging in romantic gestures since men find it special</li><li>Making him feel less insecure to avoid him getting glum or avoiding you.</li></ul><p class=align-left>You can also take care of your boyfriend by ensuring he does not take you for granted.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ff37673d11fe39d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 black couples goals that will make your love stronger</span></p></a><h3>2. Enhance what made him attracted to you</h3><p class=align-left>Men get attracted to women in different ways. It could be your smile, your looks of love, your body type, or your interactions. One of your girlfriend duties is to enhance the things that got him attracted to you. Figure out the various ways of letting him see more of them so that he can remember how amazing you are.</p><h3>3. Motivate him</h3><p class=align-left>Knowing how to treat your boyfriend well is not enough if you are not motivating him. As a girlfriend, you possess some unique powers that can inspire your man to help him to achieve his potential. Men tend to behave masculinely. But it is the selfless love of her woman that makes him want to change and become better.</p><h3>4. Luxuriate him in a public display of affection</h3><p class=align-left>Men appreciate some form of light physical contact from the women they have a love interest. Although men do not care about a public display of affection, they love it when it is their girlfriend that does it. Holding his hand, putting your arm around him, and touching him fondly makes him gain insights into your thoughts of him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a329d0f18dc6ec02.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 behavioural signs of Taurus man when he likes you</span></p></a><h3>5.

It is one of the top responsibilities in a relationship. You can make your man happy by:</p><ul><li>Finding out what he wants from you</li><li>Not ignoring him even when he is with his friends</li><li>Praising him all times even in front of others</li><li>Satisfying him emotionally and sexually</li></ul><h3>6. Dress well for him</h3><p class=align-left>A girl that looks good regularly attracts a man. While it may seem cliché, it is a girl’s responsibility to <a href=#>dress</a> well and look sexy for her boyfriend. That also includes wearing a sexy outfit while in bed if you are in an intimate relationship.</p><h3>7. Be there as a support system</h3><p class=align-left>It is natural for men to act strong. That is despite many of them suffering and tearing apart from inside. If you want to know how to become a good girlfriend, make it your responsibility to support him whenever he is undergoing or facing a difficult time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys stare but never approach me?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Do not expect him to tell you what he is going through because men do not like looking weak. But encourage him to open up and show him support.</p><h3>8. Be a good listener</h3><p class=align-left>What do girlfriends do? In any girlfriend-boyfriend relationship, one of the best qualities a girl can have is to listen to their partner and comprehend whatever they are telling each other.</p><p class=align-left>As a good girlfriend, understand that you may not be in a position to solve all of your man’s problems. Since he realises this, be there to listen to him. It will make him feel that he is not alone.</p><h3>9. Make him part of your life</h3><p class=align-left>If you have ever wondered what a boyfriend wants from his girlfriend, he wants you to make him part of your world. When you make your boyfriend part of your life, it makes him comfortable to be around you. Introduce him to your friends and <a href=#>family</a>, show him your interests, and compromise where necessary.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f39ac4e902a235e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My girlfriend has a celebrity crush: Should I be worried?</span></p></a><h3>10. Treat others well</h3><p class=align-left>Treating people well is one of the most basic human and life requirements. No man wants to stick with a woman that cannot treat others with kindness and respect. When you are kind to others, especially his family, it shows him you want to be with him and that the people around him are important to you too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ff37673d11fe39d.jpg><h3>11. Be honest</h3><p class=align-left>Being honest with your boyfriend is a responsibility as his girlfriend. A man does not want to be with a dishonest or untruthful person. Furthermore, understand that men are not good at guessing. Making them guess what is in your mind will turn them off.</p><p class=align-left>Be honest and say anything you are feeling or thinking. It will make it easier for him to deal with what arises.</p><h3>12. Satisfy him sexually</h3><p class=align-left>When you get excited to please your man, it makes all the difference in his <a href=#>world</a>. Satisfy him sexually by getting him into the groove and making sex fun for not only him but you too. While it is not necessary to do everything he wants you to do, communicate your desires and cater to him a bit. Open up about both of your sexual desires to make it satisfying for the two of you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><h3>13. Be yourself</h3><p class=align-left>The worst thing you can do in a relationship is to be a fake person so that you can impress your boyfriend. While you may think he will prefer your phoney self at first, it only goes to show that both of you are not compatible. Be yourself and do not pretend to be someone you are not.</p><h3>14. Work with him</h3><p class=align-left>Like many relationships, there are times when two people engage in conflicts and disagreements. While this happens all the time, you should work with him as a team. When you work with him, he will have your back. But most importantly, work together to fix things and do not let him do it alone.</p><h3>15. Buy him a gift</h3><p class=align-left>You can make your relationship fun by buying your boyfriend a small <a href=#>gift</a>. Men love getting presents from their girlfriends. Give him something special whenever you feel loving. Each present you give him will let him know you care and mean so much to him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7837e1645580ee67.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Role of a man in a relationship</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It pays to know the most fundamental girlfriend duties in a relationship.

Entertain him</h3><p class=align-left>It is the duty of a girlfriend to entertain their boyfriend. You don't have to keep him occupied at all times but at least ensure that you are his source of joy.

Whether funny or not, laugh at all his <a href=#>jokes</a> and listen to his stories, whether they are exciting or not.</p><h3>23. Offer him a shoulder to cry on</h3><p class=align-left>Every person needs a shoulder, not cry, and this is no different to men. They, too, need a shoulder to cry on. As a girlfriend, it is your duty to allow your boyfriend to be vulnerable without judging him or using it against him. Always make sure that he knows that he can reach out to you whenever he feels like rock bottom.</p><h3>24. Give him his personal space</h3><p class=align-left>Every person needs their personal space, and this includes your boyfriend too.

Show him that you are secure with his love</h3><p class=align-left>It is the role of a girlfriend to show his boyfriend that she appreciates and feels secure. Immature women keep asking their men to prove their love, and it is not a great thing to do. It is a sign that you are not secure with the love he is professing to you.</p><p class=align-left>However, this should not be the case since he has already proven his love by pursuing you and winning you over. Therefore, he doesn't have to tell you he loves you daily or grab everyone's attention to prove that he loves you.</p><h3>29. Know how to have fun</h3><p class=align-left>Having fun means different things to different people. However, no man wants to be with a girlfriend who is always stiff and conscious.
