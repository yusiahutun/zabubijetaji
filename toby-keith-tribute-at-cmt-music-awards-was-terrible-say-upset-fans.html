The <a href=#>music</a> star passed away on February 6, with a heartbreaking statement posted on the singer’s website announcing the news. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> was previously honored at the <a href=#>awards show</a>, having won seven statues and being nominated more than 30 times throughout his career. He performed at the event 13 times and hosted it twice, alongside <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a> in 2003 and again with Kristen Bell nine years later.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-toby-keith-s-tribute-at-the-cmt-music-awards>Toby Keith’s tribute at the CMT Music Awards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1350326045-1024x683.jpg><p>A number of segments honored Toby Keith at the CMT Music Awards, including Brooks & Dunn, Lainey Wilson and Sammy Hagar performing to honor the star.</p><p>Keith had died two months ago after a <a href=#>long battle with stomach cancer</a>, aged 62.</p><p>His 2011 track, Red Solo Cup, appeared to be the creative inspiration for one part of the tribute where his family, friends and fellow stars hold them up in his memory. The event, broadcast on CBS and Paramount+, saw Hagar wear a shirt with his friend’s name printed on it.</p><p><strong>NEVER FORGOTTEN</strong>: <a href=#>Remembering movie and TV icons we lost last year</a></p><p>New York Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens joined the stars on the CMT Music Awards stage for the tribute to his friend Toby Keith.</p><p>But it seemed that it was getting to him, as he appeared choked up as he thanked Keith’s family in the audience. His wife Tricia Lucus and their children Shelley, Krystal and Stelen attended.</p><p>Clemens said across the crowd: “Thank you for sharing your dad with all of us – thank you.</p><p>“Trish, we love you. Thank you for sharing your husband with the world, Trish. Thank you.”</p><p>The camera panned to the family, who were wiping away tears.</p><p>He added: “Alright, real quick: Raise ’em up. Everybody at home, raise your fist if you don’t have a Solo cup. Let Toby hear you. Repeat after me, “Whiskey for my men,” and, “Beer for my horses” – let’s go!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-stories-about-the-singer>Stories about the singer</h2><p>As part of the ongoing tributes, some stars told stories about Keith before performing some of his hits.</p><p>76-year-old Hagar said of their time in Mexico: “Toby and I, we spent a lot of time in Cabo together over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>“I mean we closed the Cabo Wabo down a lot more times than we even remember – it’s hard to get thrown out of your own bar, and we managed to do that.”</p><p>He then performed the 2003 hit I Love This Bar.</p><p>Lukas Nelson, son of <a href=#>Willie Nelson</a>, said Keith wasn’t shy and had a ‘big personality’. He met the star when he was younger and said he got “lucky I got the opportunity to watch his artistry in person”.</p><p>Riley Green, 35, said: “That guy could come up with a hook like no other and sing the hell out of every song that he wrote, somehow only making it look easy.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-slam-stars-destroying-toby-keith-s-songs>Fans slam stars ‘destroying Toby Keith’s songs’</h2><p>However, the reaction has been divided from fans, over how the artists performed the icon’s records.</p><p>Some felt Lainey had changed the lyrics to one song, and claimed other stars didn’t know the words when they were on stage.</p><p>One wrote: “These people are all destroying Toby Keith’s songs! Terrible tribute!”</p><p>A second added: “Every bit of that Toby Keith Tribute was awful.”</p><p>While a third penned: “I hate to say it but what I’ve seen so far they should have got better talent to tribute him.”</p><p>Then a fourth said: “That Toby Keith Tribute on the CMT Music Awards was TERRIBLE!!!!! I love Brooks and Dunn but they BUTCHERED “Should Have Been a Cowboy”.</p><p>“Sammy Hagar was terrible on “I Love This Bar”. Lainey Wilson changing the words to “How Do You Like Me Now”. Ugh. TK deserved better.”</p><p>But not all viewers felt the same way.</p><p>One Twitter user declared: “The fact that everybody was raising red solo cups for the life of Toby Keith was incredibly appropriate, since Toby himself did have a crossover hit about the titular red solo cup.”</p><p>And another said: “As a lifelong Toby Keith fan, that tribute was absolutely beautiful</p><p>“Seeing his babies made it even more special. Thank you for sharing him with us Shelley, Krystal, and Stelen. We miss you, Toby.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2WFcMDOm7Bmo5Wewal506ugm62kmnqiwIycpK1lnarAqq%2BMmq6aqpSoerit0marnqqinq%2BtsYysmLJlpaXApsCMn5inq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./annemarie-morin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is AnneMarie Morin dating?
