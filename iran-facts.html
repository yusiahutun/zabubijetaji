It is also important to consider that Iranian women are only allowed to show limited body parts in public.

Common usage for the set-up is for the satiation of male pilgrims visiting holy shrines away from families.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-48>In Iran, the police could force a man to marry his rape victim regardless of her assent.</h2><p>However, the rapist could divorce the victim right after the ceremony.

They could be eaten with ‘kebab’ or pieces of meat/poultry or minced meat grilled on an open fire or with ‘khoreshtes.’</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-52>The world-famous ‘Persian Longhair’ or ‘Shiraz Cat’ is native to Iran.</h2><p>This breed’s rise to fame started in 19th-century Europe and America after WWII. Endemic to Iran, Persian <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>cats</a> have distinct features of woolly fur and round, grouchy faces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/gardens-in-iran-persian-culture.jpg><h2 class=content-title id=title-53>The Persian cat counts among the oldest breeds in the world.</h2><p>Their origins could be traced back to Iran’s high plateaus where their long woolly, silky fur protects them from the cold. In the 17th century, Italian traders introduced the breed to Europe where they immediately became an exotic status symbol.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-54>Soccer is the most popular sport in Iran.</h2><p>Their national team conquered the Asian Cup 3 times and even played in 3 World Cup Final competitions.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-55>In 1948, Iran started participating in the Olympics.</h2><p>Since then, the country has sent athletes to play in every Summer Olympic Games except only for 1980 and 1984.
