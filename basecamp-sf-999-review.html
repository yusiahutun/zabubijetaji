However, with the rise in this environmentally friendly trend comes a sobering reality: a surge in bike accidents and fatalities. According to recent statistics, NYC has witnessed a dramatic increase in bike-related incidents, caused by factors ranging from distracted drivers to road rage and treacherous road conditions. As a resident of this vibrant metropolis, I am frequently experiencing the challenges of navigating these less-than-ideal streets. For years, I've been interested in finding new and practical ways to improve safety without compromising the riding experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-riding-bike-1.jpg><p>This brings us to the recently released Basecamp SF-999 smart bike helmet. With its integrated turn signals, hazard lights, and Bluetooth connectivity, this "smart" helmet aims to address the pressing challenge of improving biking safety. But the question remains: does it possess the necessary capabilities to make a meaningful difference?</p><h5 class=display-card-title>Basecamp SF-999</h5>5<span>/ 10</span><p class=display-card-description>Despite its potential, the Basecamp SF-999 smart bike helmet isn't as "smart" and cutting-edge as it seems. Despite its touted features, including integrated turn signals and Bluetooth connectivity, the helmet falls short in several key aspects. The subpar microphone and speaker quality and the unfinished overall experience leave much to be desired. As a result, relying on traditional hand signals and using personal earbuds may still be a more effective and satisfying solution for cyclists seeking a superior riding experience.</p><strong>Brand</strong> <span>Basecamp</span> <strong>Connectivity</strong> <span>Bluetooth 5.3</span> <strong>Color</strong> <span>Black or White</span> <strong>Material</strong> <span>In-mold Polycarbonate Shell with EPS liner</span> <strong>Battery</strong> <span>3.5 hours to charge</span> <strong>Weight</strong> <span>0.85 lbs (385g)</span> <strong>Battery Life</strong> <span>16 hours lights only, 8 hours music only, 5 hours lights + music</span> <strong>Battery Type</strong> <span>3.7v 1000mah Rechargeable Lithium Polymer</span> <strong>Input</strong> <span>USB-C</span> <strong>Size</strong> <span>22- 24 in/(56 - 61 cm)</span> <strong>Ventilation</strong> <span>5 Vents and Deep Internal Channeling</span> <strong>Waterproof</strong> <span>IPX5</span> <strong>Crash Rating</strong> <span>CPSC 16 C.F.R part1203, ASTM F1447, CE EN1078</span> <strong>Lining</strong> <span>Quick-dry padding</span> <strong>Lights</strong> <span>Rear turn signals, rear hazard light</span> <strong class=sub-title>Pros</strong><ul class=pro-list><li class=icon>Comfortable fit</li><li class=icon>Quick adjustments</li><li class=icon>Excellent ventilation</li><li class=icon>Turn signals and lights increase visibility, especially at night</li></ul><strong class=sub-title>Cons</strong><ul class=con-list><li class=icon>No front lights or turn signals</li><li class=icon>Helmet does not provide additional safety for oncoming traffic</li><li class=icon>Annoying looping reminder when turn signals are on</li><li class=icon>Bluetooth connection is disabled while turn signals are active</li><li class=icon>Microphone and speaker quality are very bad</li><li class=icon>Simple hand signals and an AirPod are often more effective</li></ul><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Buy at Basecampboards</a><h2 id=what-makes-this-smart>What Makes This "Smart"?</h2><p>On the back of the helmet, you'll find the stars of the show, a left and right integrated turn signal, and a middle hazard light which is either toggled on or off. Just as with a car or motorcycle, you can use these to let those behind you know your intention, or you simply turn on the main light for increased visibility. Great in concept, but we'll discuss how well this works later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-rear-view.jpg><p>Cyclists can connect their smartphones via Bluetooth for media playback or listen to GPS navigation directions. The helmet is equipped with a single down-firing speaker on each side near the ears. On the one hand, its built-in speakers are great in concept, but its audio quality and volume leave much to be desired. The helmet uses a 3.7v 1000mah Lithium battery that charges via USB-C and can give you up to 16 hours in its light-only modes, 8 hours with music playback, and 5 hours with lights and music playback.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-holding-helmet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The helmet also features a microphone near the front for added convenience. This enables hands-free calling functionality while riding, but just like the speakers, voice quality is not impressive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-helmet-controls.jpg><p>To control these features, the Basecamp SF-999 comes with a dedicated strapped remote control. The remote can be securely fastened to the bike's handlebar to provide quick and convenient access to various controls. This includes activating turn indicators, pausing or playing media, adjusting the helmet's volume independently of the phone's volume settings, and controlling media playback navigation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-controller-on-handlebar-3.jpg><p>For connectivity, the SF-999 uses Bluetooth 5.3. It is also IPX5 waterproof, meaning it can withstand water splashes and light rain without damaging its electronic components, though you should probably avoid riding in heavier rain with this. The helmet has undergone crash testing and meets recognized safety standards, including CPSC 16 C.F.R Part 1203, ASTM F1447, and CE EN1078.</p><p>Though it might make your handle grips feel cramped, installing the controller on the inner sides is best so your thumb can easily reach the buttons.</p><h2 id=fit-and-design>Fit and Design</h2><p>Before getting into how well the Basecamp SF-999 functions, let's closely examine its design. Our review model has an all-black color scheme, a single brand logo on the back, and a removable sticker on the right side. There is also an all-white design if you prefer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-sticker.jpg><p>The helmet weighs 0.85 lbs (385g) and can be adjusted between 22-24 inches (56-61 cm) with its pull knob FR fit system. This allows for quick release of compression by pulling it up. You then push the knob back in and turn it for precise tension.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-adjusting-fit-1.jpg><p>During testing, we found the SF-999 to be very comfortable thanks to its quick-dry liner, which is well padded, and proprietary wind ventilation system which provides excellent airflow. Even during a ride of over 16 miles on an 80+ degree sunny day, the helmet provided ample breathability.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-liner-padding-1.jpg><p>On its front, there is a slight plastic lip, though I wouldn't consider it a sun visor. Below that, you'll find two buttons; one for turning on the helmet, and the other, which either turns on the solid rear light or, when held longer, will enter Bluetooth pairing mode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-left-side.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=great-concept-but-half-baked>Great Concept, but Half-Baked</h2><p>While the Basecamp SF-999 smart bike helmet presents a promising concept, my testing revealed several quirks and limitations that make it feel like a prototype rather than a final product. Several aspects of the helmet seem cheap. As soon as I powered this helmet on, I knew things would be rough: the Bluetooth interface features the infamous broken English voice prompt such as "the Bluetooth device is now connected successfully".</p><p>If you've heard it, you'll know it's usually exclusive to cheap generic Bluetooth speakers. It would be one thing if you just had to hear it when powering the helmet on/off or pairing a new Bluetooth device, but as there is no other way to let you know that your turn signals are on, the helmet also uses this voice to say "turn left beware" or "turn right beware" on loop or until you click on the controller again to end your turn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-hazard-light-at-night.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As annoying as that is, even worse, the Bluetooth connection seems to be completely paused while the turn signals are active. You are unable to hear music, GPS directions, or be heard on a call until the turn is completed. While it may not seem that bad, picture yourself in a left lane waiting for the oncoming traffic to die down before you can cross. For myself, and I'm sure a lot of others would feel the same way, this annoyance is enough to make me not want to use my indicators at all. Which kind of defeats the purpose of this helmet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-helmet-controller.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another physical limitation is the absence of front-facing turn signals, or any kind of front light. Given how most left turns involve crossing in front of other vehicles, it becomes more important to communicate intentions to those ahead of the rider rather than those behind. Having front turn signals would dramatically enhance visibility and improve safety. Based on how I ride, if I had to choose between the two, I actually would have preferred having my indicators on the front.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-wearing-left.jpg><p>The location of the controller strap also poses challenges. While the innermost side of the handle grips seems like the most practical placement for quick and easy access to the turn signals, even in heavy and fast-moving traffic, constantly looking down at the controller and ensuring the correct button is pressed can be troublesome. This can result in wasted time and potentially unsafe situations, such as when encountering obstacles or needing to make split-second decisions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-controller-on-handlebar-1-2.jpg><p>The microphone and speaker quality of the Basecamp SF-999 smart bike helmet left much to be desired. While I acknowledge the challenge of overcoming road noise and wind interference, it became evident that the components used in the helmet were of low quality. During my extensive testing, which involved listening to music and podcasts, and engaging in voice calls, the performance was underwhelming. Unless I was riding at a leisurely pace of 8mph or less, the audio experience was far from satisfactory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-riding-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The helmet's speakers proved to be inadequate, as they struggled to reach sufficient volume levels and produced a tinny sound. I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but it was clear that the audio quality fell below expectations. To put it bluntly, the speakers were simply subpar. Surprisingly, even a disposable pair of over-ear headphones typically provided on airplanes would offer a better audio experience than this helmet.</p><p>Adding to the frustration was that the helmet's volume control operated independently of the connected device or phone. This meant that users had to first adjust the volume on their phones before being able to control the helmet's volume. This extra step was inconvenient and further highlighted the helmet's shortcomings in user experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The microphone quality shared a similar disappointing story. People on the other end of voice calls reported that my voice sounded distorted, and wind noise was apparent. This further compromised the functionality of the helmet's communication features, which were supposed to enable hands-free calls while riding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-riding-3.jpg><p>In many ways, relying on my AirPods Pro with transparency mode enabled proved far more practical. Unsurprisingly, the audio quality was significantly better, but the same can be said with the microphone quality too. During voice calls, those on the receiving end could hardly discern that I was riding my bike unless my speed exceeded 14mph. Obviously, the AirPods Pro cost nearly twice as much as the helmet itself. However, the crucial point to emphasize is that if you're considering the Basecamp SF-999 for its "smart" features, it's likely that you already own and use a pair of earbuds that would outperform this helmet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sometimes-dumb-is-better>Sometimes "Dumb" is Better</h2><p>Despite its promising concept, the Basecamp SF-999 smart bike helmet ultimately falls short in several crucial areas, displaying various quirks and limitations that hinder its ability to reach its full potential. As I embarked on this review with high expectations, I felt underwhelmed and occasionally frustrated by the helmet's performance.</p><p>On the one hand, the added visibility you gain behind you with its lights, especially at night, is significantly improved than with them off. But on the other, a simple, and cheap flashing bike light can be just as effective for the most part.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-using-turn-signals-at-night-in-traffic.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, the audio and microphone quality, while initially anticipated to be significant features, proved to be less important compared to the helmet's core safety functionality. In fact, I would have preferred a helmet without these "smart" features altogether if it meant that its core operation was perfected. As it stands, using your earbuds, old-school hand signals, and any traditional helmet, is more often an easier and more reliable solution, not to mention significantly less annoying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/basecamp-sf-999-riding-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While addressing this wouldn't completely fix all of its issues, the simple addition of front lights and turn signals and an update to its Bluetooth module would dramatically enhance this helmet's practicality and usability during my rides. If future iterations of the helmet could introduce these enhancements, I believe it has the potential to become an outstanding product that I would genuinely enjoy using. However, in its current state, the Basecamp SF-999 falls short of fulfilling its promise of making me safer on my bike rides. Although the helmet demonstrates promise, it ultimately fails to deliver a polished experience that I can count on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiZmquVmK6uvIysnWZxaW56s7HVopywZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-douglas-white-facebook-boasts-american-psycho-fan-hacked-exs-mother-boyfriend-dead-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Douglas White: Facebook boasts of American Psycho fan who hacked ex's mother and boyfriend dea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anne-hathaway-metallic-gold-sunglasses-7546626.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anne Hathaways Stylist Says Gold Sunglasses Are Trending This Summer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
