His cause of death was a gunshot wound to the chest, and police have charged his wife, Christine Roberts, with criminal homicide.</p><p>According to an<a href=#>&nbsp;arrest warrant</a>, a neighbor heard the gunshot and called 911 after finding Roberts lying on the porch. Police officers responded to the scene and recovered a pistol beside Christine, who told them that she had shot her husband because he cheated on her.</p><p>In a remembrance of Roberts that Travis posted to Facebook, the country star describes his late lighting director as a friend as well as "one of the very best stage lighting technicians in the business."</p><p>"Thom not only had a magical sense about lighting a stage; but, he had a quiet, charismatic presence that ignited your soul. Always willing, with a 'can do' and 'happy to do it' attitude," Travis writes. "He was a gentle giant of a man that wore a constant smile on his face and carried a song in his heart. One would search a lifetime to find a kinder, gentler spirit. Thom was my friend and I loved him dearly."</p><p>Following Roberts' death, Bandit Lites, Inc., Vice President Michael Golden remembered his late colleague as a talented professional who played a formative role on country music's stages for decades.</p><p>"I got to know Thom in the early '90s when I had the opportunity to work with him as the supplier of lighting for<a href=#> Vince Gill</a>," Golden stated, "and I consider Thom one of the 'old guard' that transformed the wild west of touring into a respected and professional career. Thom worked for many artists and institutions around the city, but anytime I ever heard his name a smile would cross my face. This city and our music community will miss Thom, but we will all be better because of his reputation and the foundation he helped build."</p><p>Travis' More Life Tour will resume later this month without Roberts, but the country legend says he's cherishing the memories of his work with his late lighting director.</p><p>"The music will not be near as sweet; but, I will once again be reminded of the blessing I was given to have Thom Roberts on the road with us for so many miles, and so many memories," Travis continues.</p><p>"I know I speak for the entire band and crew when I say the light that he truly created, in our hearts, will never be extinguished or forgotten," he concludes.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>R.I.P: Remembering Country Stars Who Died in 2023</h2><p>Take a moment to remember the country artists, songwriters and other industry members we've lost in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq5memcZuwNGaraKrXaG2qLTToqWgZZSev6av06ipZqyYpLqiv4yrppudoqnAbr%2FHqKtmo5mhuaawjJuwZq%2BZm7Jw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./klassy-network-brami-tops-review-7095958.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Klassy Network Brami Tops Replaced My Bras</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./leeann-tweeden.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Leeann Tweeden Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
