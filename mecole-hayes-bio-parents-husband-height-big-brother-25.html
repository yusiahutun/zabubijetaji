She said, “I am so excited to be on the iconic BB 25th season. I’m excited for all of the twists and turns. I’m sure we’re going to see some things from the past and maybe some things from the future pop up. So, I’m really excited for what’s to come.”</p><p>Watching Xavier and Taylor from previous seasons win the show, Mecole decided to participate in the show. According to her, she couldn’t let go of the chance of winning $750,000. She believed the odds were in her favor.</p><p>By her admission, Mecole was going to play the show like a politician.

Hayers Capers and Riccardo Walker, on the other hand, were the designated groomsmen.</p><p>Mecole met her future husband, at U-Street in Washington, D.C. Their meet-cute is well documented on the knot.com. An excerpt from the website read, “Meme caught Damien’s eye while standing alone at the bar after a failed girl’s night out. Just as she was preparing to leave and go crawl into bed, Damien made his way next to her and asked, “So you’re just going to walk past me without telling me your name?”, and the rest was history.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mecole-hayes-husband-300x244.jpg><p>Damien, as noted on his LinkedIn, is a Senior Information System Security Officer at Open Systems Technologies Corporation.
