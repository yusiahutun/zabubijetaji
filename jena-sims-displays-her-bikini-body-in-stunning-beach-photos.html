The former actress, who is known for her glamorous lifestyle and romantic moments with her husband, shared a series of stunning bikini snaps on her personal Instagram account story. While posing for the camera, a playful child unexpectedly appeared in the background of her photo, prompting Sims to humorously comment in her caption: "No thirst traps on my watch."</p><p>Sims has a strong presence on social media and frequently showcases her impeccable fashion sense by modeling high-end designer clothing. Although her acting career has primarily consisted of roles in made-for-TV movies, she was crowned Miss Georgia Teen USA in 2007.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MASTERS 2022: From Paulina Gretzky to Kelley Cahill, the hottest golfing WAGS at Augusta</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Paige Spiranac said 'no' to playing golf with male celebs</a></p><h2 class=split>Relationship with Koepka</h2><p>In 2017, professional golfer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooks Koepka</a> began a relationship with actress, model, and philanthropist Jena Sims. The couple recently exchanged vows in June 2022. "We met at the 2015 Masters," Sims shared with Golf Digest in 2018. "We were on Hole 7, which I don't even remember, but he's like, 'Oh, I remember what you were wearing, where we were standing, everything.' It was cool... We were just friends at that point", she added.</p><p>Sims and Koepka made their relationship public during the US Open in 2017, but the reveal was marred by an awkward moment. Announcer Joe Buck mistakenly identified Sims as Koepka's ex-girlfriend Becky Edwards on TV. The couple eventually confirmed their relationship when Sims posted an Instagram photo of them together with friends during a trip to Las Vegas. Their first public appearance as a couple on the red carpet was at the 2017 ESPY Awards. After four years of dating, Koepka proposed to Sims in&nbsp; March 2021 during a trip to Jupiter, Florida. Sims shared photos of the intimate moment on her Instagram a month later, captioning it "Forever is no joke." The couple kicked off their wedding festivities in Turks and Caicos with a lavish welcome dinner for some of their guests on June 1, 2022, before officially tying the knot on June 4th.</p><h2 class=split>Into the Top 24 in SI Swimsuit's Swim Search</h2><p>In a recent announcement, Koepka shared that she had successfully made the cut for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit's Swim Search, which had narrowed down its initial prospects to only 24 individuals. As a result, model, and philanthropist, Sims, expressed her excitement in a TikTok video, exclaiming, "Well, I just cried in the shower...I made the top 24 for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit. If you watched my last video, I just talked about how it was literally my biggest dream, still is, and always will be. So, to be one step closer is amazing."</p><p>Sims went on to describe the upcoming group casting process, stating, "Top 24 is going to be interviewing in a group casting next week. I am so excited." She then expressed gratitude towards her supporters, and said, "This is the beginning, hopefully, of a beautiful new chapter of my life. I feel so grateful to be able to be chasing my dreams," as tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoopWjrm6%2FyKaqZpyZqL2trdisZKGdomKvqrfIp6Bmmp%2BZxm61zWaqra2eo7avs4ybnJqbmGK9qbvTqKo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./may5-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>May 5 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./437337-jamaican-reggae-singer-cocoa-tea-overcoming-feelings-depression.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jamaican Reggae Singer Cocoa Tea Says He Is Overcoming Feelings of Depression</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
