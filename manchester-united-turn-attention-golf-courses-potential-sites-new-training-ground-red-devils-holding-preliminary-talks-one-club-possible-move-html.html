Ratcliffe (left) set to take control of football operations</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The belief is that the existing site is at maximum capacity, suffers from a shortage of parking space and that acquiring vast acreage elsewhere may be the best option.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It can be disclosed that talks took place with High Legh Park Golf Club but an agreement was not reached. A woodland course situated in Knutsford, it ticked many boxes, not least because it was close to where many of United’s players live.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>High Legh features an 18-hole Championship course, 9-hole course and 24-bay floodlit driving range, along with a golf retail store, clubhouse bar and restaurant. The course was bought by Warrington-based American Golf for £2.7m in 2021 and put up for sale last year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sources have disclosed that the situation remains ‘fluid’. One option is to build a new facility and keep Carrington and former base The Cliff, spreading the training operation across various sites. United’s women’s side and academy could, for example, remain at Carrington, with the men’s team located at a new facility. The preference, however, is to host everyone on one site, should a location big enough be found.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Interestingly, Ratcliffe’s INEOS hold the rights to explore for shale gas beneath Carrington. The petrochemicals giant own a 60 per cent stake in an onshore oil and gas licence covering large swathes of Trafford – including the training ground.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It remains to be seen who would foot the bill for such a move should United find somewhere suitable elsewhere and decide to act. When his 25 per cent investment is ratified, INEOS billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe will take control of football operations.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-530b3a32eb575de4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/01/16/17/80092607-12970233-image-a-3_1705425371373.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="It is understood that any site would need to be a minimum of 100 acres of buildable land to come anywhere near to matching United¿s demands" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>It is understood that any site would need to be a minimum of 100 acres of buildable land to come anywhere near to matching United’s demands</p><img id=i-fa00b06ad9c7768b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/01/16/17/80093409-12970233-image-a-13_1705427991915.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="United¿s chief operating officer Collette Roche is overseeing the project along with Mags Mernagh, who designed Leicester City's new, 185-acre training ground" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>United’s chief operating officer Collette Roche is overseeing the project along with Mags Mernagh, who designed Leicester City's new, 185-acre training ground</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>IT'S ALL KICKING OFF!&nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic><span class=mol-style-bold>It's All Kicking Off is an exciting new podcast from Mail Sport that promises a different take on Premier League football.</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic><span class=mol-style-bold>It is available on <a style=font-weight:700 href=#>MailOnline</a>, <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Mail+</a>, <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>YouTube</a>, <a style=font-weight:700 rel=nofollow href=#>Apple Music</a> and <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Spotify</a>.</span></span></p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/sport/football/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>He has already vowed to spend £250m on Old Trafford, although expenditure on a training facility may well be viewed as a grey area and is likely to need agreement from both Ratcliffe and the Glazers.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>United’s chief operating officer Collette Roche is overseeing the project.
