He’s a really decent little horse, he got conditions to suit and he didn’t let anyone down.</p><p>“You don’t get as many opportunities [in Group Ones] as I’m accustomed to in Australia, but it is what it is. It’s just a different system, but it was good racing [on Sunday] and it was good to be a part of it.”</p><p>Despite spending a considerable chunk of the season sidelined through injury and suspensions, Bowman sits third in the jockeys’ premiership with 49 wins and will look to add to that tally at the city circuit on Wednesday night.</p><p>The 43-year-old identified Galaxy Witness, Celestial Colours and Diamond Soars as his key chances, while he will also team up with last-start placegetters Big Two and Kasa Papa and John Size’s debutant Sweet Smile.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/29/935e27db-f85a-4611-8900-180a94c10c5e_18572fde.jpg data-fid=14994857 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1219 title="Hugh Bowman laps up Group One glory on Invincible Sage at Sha Tin." alt="Hugh Bowman laps up Group One glory on Invincible Sage at Sha Tin." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Galaxy Witness drops back to Class Three for only the second time since 2022 when he tackles the Deauville Handicap (1,650m).</p><p>The Caspar Fownes-trained gelding showed big potential when unbeaten from his first four starts and despite failing to win since 2022, he has raced consistently in stronger company.</p><p>The son of Star Witness has twice this season been placed at the course and distance of Wednesday night’s race and Bowman was elated when he drew barrier three.</p><p>“He’s a consistent horse and he’s got a good draw, which is a huge benefit for him with his racing style,” Bowman said.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>🗣️ "He's a very good horse in the making!"</p><p>Yes he is! 🔥 Galaxy Witness extends his perfect record to three with a stylish victory in the finale for Joao Moreira & Caspar Fownes. <a href=#>#HKracing</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/h2gjBbvUvl</a></p>— HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) <a href=#>March 6, 2022</a><p>“A few times I’ve ridden him, he’s drawn wide and with the big weight (135 pounds), it’s a big help to draw in.”</p><p>Bowman is maintaining his faith in the Jamie Richards-trained Celestial Colours, who heads into the Class Three France Galop Cup (1,200m) off the back of a fair fifth behind Kaholo Angel last start.</p><p>“He might have looked a bit under-par to the eye last start, but I was satisfied with him,” Bowman said of Celestial Colours, who was five weeks between runs.</p><p>“He’s obviously a go-forward horse and there doesn’t look much other speed in it actually, so that might suit him. Barrier 10 might end up being all right if there isn’t much of a charge, but we’ll see.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/29/db408bd4-ae8a-48e0-817d-b983b051c9e4_e349c653.jpg data-fid=14994858 data-resolution=1 width=2000 height=1355 title="Hugh Bowman guides Celestial Colours to victory at Happy Valley on March 6." alt="Hugh Bowman guides Celestial Colours to victory at Happy Valley on March 6." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Bowman expects Ricky Yiu Poon-fai’s Diamond Soars to relish a drop in grade in the Class Five Maisons-Laffitte Handicap (1,000m).</p><p>“He’s well placed in Class Five, so he’s a good ride,” he said. “They’re good rides. In my experience, you don’t get many stand-out rides at Happy Valley.</p><p>“They’re all pretty evenly rated and bunched and it really boils down to getting the right run and the right pace, and it’s hard to predict that.”</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6VaW5ubV%2Bdwqi0jJumsKWRo3q1wdGnqmaZpKmyr8DIqKVmoJGlvbp51ZqjpZ2pYq6nwMSrZK2Zo6m2r7OMoKmoraBivK%2BxjKCjqKqpYrCprcypoKimo2KxosU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./22-captivating-facts-about-carlson-young.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>22 Captivating Facts About Carlson Young</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bella-rolland-wiki-bio-net-worth-boyfriend-height-weight-age-measurements.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bella Rolland Wiki, Bio, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Height, Weight, Age, Measurements</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
