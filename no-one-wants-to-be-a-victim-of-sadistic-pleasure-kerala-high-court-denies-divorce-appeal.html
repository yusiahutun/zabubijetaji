On the basis of the Apex court decisions, the court argued that mere inconvenience, irritation, as well as isolated incidents would not qualify as cruelty.</p><p>Regarding the current case, the accusations made by the appellant are primarily center on the respondent’s incapacity to maintain a friendly family life despite looking out for the needs of the appellant as well as his parents. It is not acceptable to classify the previously mentioned incompability attributed to a life partner as cruelty sufficient to justify the demise of the marriage.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Husband alleges wife of marital cruelty</h4><p>Husband claimed that shortly after their 1994 marriage, the wife began to mistreat, act in an impolite manner as well as insult him.
