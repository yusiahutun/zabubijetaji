For the past couple of seasons, I’ve been wondering. Long gloves were on runways at JW Anderson and Balenciaga last September, after all. They cropped up recently at the most-talked-about Paris shows, like Rocha’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a46520647/simone-rocha-jean-paul-gaultier-couture-collection-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="highly anticipated return" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">highly anticipated return</a> to the calendar, the always viral <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week/a60010752/paris-fashion-week-fall2024-saint-laurent-dior-ester-manas-vaquera/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Vaquera class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Vaquera</a>, or trend-prophesying <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week/a60112460/miu-miu-chanel-fall-winter-2024/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Miu Miu" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Miu Miu</a>.

On social media, the look was a clear winner of the night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="default_cursor_cs css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, opera gloves have never been part of my own style vocabulary, mostly because my hands already feel dressed up with my long acrylic nails. People always inquire how I can operate with three-inch pieces of oval-shaped plastic stuck to my nail beds, and I tell them it’s like my hands are wearing stilettos. They make me feel powerfully feminine—my fingertips glide across my keyboard like Carrie Bradshaw sprinting across Bleecker Street in Manolos.</p><img alt="carey mulligan" title="96th Annual Oscars - Arrivals" width=5247 height=7346 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2066796027-65ef83891c7bd.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gilbert Flores for Variety</span><p>Carey Mulligan in an archival 1950s Balenciaga gown and long velvet gloves at the 2024 Oscars</p><img alt="los angeles, california february 24 greta lee attends the 30th annual screen actors guild awards at shrine auditorium and expo hall on february 24, 2024 in los angeles, california photo by kevin mazurgetty images" title="30th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards - Arrivals" width=3783 height=5674 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/greta-lee-sag-look-65f20923be680.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kevin Mazur</span><p>Greta Lee at the SAG Awards in a pistachio gown by the Row—a look toughened up by scrunched green opera gloves</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="default_cursor_cs css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Opera gloves have the same kind of effect. They’re beautiful but frivolous. There’s no real reason to wear decorative gloves for anything other than maybe a bit of warmth. But then again, Audrey Hepburn never looked warm in gloves. She just looked fabulous.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In an effort to see if gloves could help me harness the same womanly power as a good manicure, I spent the past six months or so trying to incorporate them into my everyday style. I wanted to start at Fashion Week last September, but the weather gods had different plans. In 90-plus-degree heat, I couldn’t make it more than an hour in a pair.</p><img alt="paris, france march 05 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the miu miu womenswear fallwinter 2024 2025 show as part of paris fashion week on march 05, 2024 in paris, france photo by victor boykogetty images" title="Miu Miu : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025" width=2667 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miu-miu-65f090e6c6928.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Boyko</span><p>Bulky leather gloves accessorized most of the Miu Miu looks from the Fall 2024 collection.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="default_cursor_cs css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also, styling them was a true challenge. I kept trying them on with little leather dresses and plaid miniskirts, but it felt too costume-y, too try-hard. I couldn’t get past the fear that I looked like a PG-rated punk-rock singer from a Disney Channel original movie, about to break out into a cover of Avril Lavigne’s “Sk8er Boi.” Gloves, as I discovered, are a high-maintenance accessory.</p><img alt="paris, france february 26 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the vaquera womenswear fallwinter 2024 2025 show as part of paris fashion week on february 26, 2024 in paris, france photo by kristy sparowgetty images" title="Vaquera : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025" width=3577 height=5366 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vaquera-65f091491a51d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kristy Sparow</span><p>Vaquera offered a punk take on the opera glove for Fall/Winter 2024.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the air finally got crisp, I took my gloves back out to give them another try. I had originally borrowed them from my mother, who sang in her own (very real, not PG-rated) rock band in the ’80s and wore them onstage with all-leather outfits. When I told her I had a hard time styling them the first time around, she laughed—the kind of laugh that sounds more like pity than delight. She told me, “Well, I’m not sure what advice to give because I’ve just never had that problem.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cool!</p><img alt="a woman in a black dress" title="a woman in a black dress" width=1056 height=1634 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mommy-3-65f0915c72bcb.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of my hot mom</span><p>MY MOM! IN A ROCK BAND! IN LEATHER! OPERA GLOVES! AND FISHNET TIGHTS!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Taking a long, hard look at her photos, I realized that maybe I was being too serious. Gloves intimidated me. There is an undeniable elegant formality to them. They’re often seen at galas and worn with gowns. They’re de rigueur for white-tie events! When I asked a handful of friends how they would describe them, every single one used the word formal. And despite “quiet luxury” being a thing, formal is just not the way that people dress right now. Instead, there’s more of an emphasis on the individual than the traditional.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yet the contradictory thing about this obsession with telegraphing our personality through our style is that people have become hyperaware of how they will be perceived differently based on the way they put together an outfit. And so somehow, some of the people obsessed with personality have unwittingly become averse to the riskier, zany pieces that might insinuate they actually have one. Gloves are the kind of accessory that talk for you, and it’s not hard to see why some are intimidated by what they may say.</p><img alt="a woman taking a selfie" title="a woman taking a selfie" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1452-65f091b3eef11.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Me</span><p>In black gloves, a vintage Chanel jacket, and a tennis skirt, I felt elegant but playful.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My mom never looked formal in gloves. Instead, she looked sexy and mysterious. She looked so self-possessed, it was contagious. I felt more confident in myself just looking at a colorless two-dimensional photo of her in them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And that assured energy is why I felt drawn to them on recent runways. At the Row’s Spring 2024 show, they told a story of a woman moving with haste who still couldn’t leave the house without her go-to pair. At Balenciaga, they have become a part of the house’s visual vocabulary, so much so that seeing a Demna gown styled without them feels unnatural.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At JW Anderson, gloves felt like delicious red cherries on top of deceptively simple all-black looks. The models wearing them didn’t look like they were in costume or going to a buttoned-up event. Instead the gloves felt like extensions of their personalities and the fabulous lives they were living.</p><img alt="a woman taking a selfie in a mirror" title="a woman taking a selfie in a mirror" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1445-65f091d999de2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Me</span><p>I wouldn't wear this linen Reformation button-up and baggy Simone Rocha trousers on their own—too simple. But the leopard-print gloves made it a whole new look.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So instead of overthinking, I thought maybe I would just stop thinking entirely. I slipped the gloves on with button-up tops that felt too professional. I found they punched up all-white outfits in a way that knocked off the bridal edge. I leaned into the slightly punk-rock look of it all. But mostly, I felt really sexy with my fingertips dipped in metallic gel powder and my wrists wrapped in lace.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wearing them wasn’t always easy. My long nails made the tips comically pointy. I had to take them off to do anything, like text or unbutton my jeans or even pet my dog. I wasted more time than I’d like to admit putting on my Cartier watch over one glove, only to have to remove it every single time I wanted to do something other than exist, basically. And yet, it was worth it.</p><img alt="a person taking a selfie in a mirror" title="a person taking a selfie in a mirror" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1465-65f0920e4587a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Me</span><p>Punk gloves can feel a little like a costume, but not when they're styled with vintage Vivienne Westwood.</p><img alt="a person in a white dress taking a selfie in a mirror" title="a person in a white dress taking a selfie in a mirror" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1485-65f0922e13e1b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Me</span><p>Oddly, these bridal-esque white gloves somehow made my Cecilie Bahnsen dress feel less saccharine.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The decadent delight of gloves is that they’re a little bit silly and also ritualistic. They’ve become a symbol of dated formalities and hot rock ’n’ roll stage presence. And when so much of style right now feels like a color-by-numbers code people are trying to crack, off-kilter quirks are refreshing. It’s exciting to stumble a little and feel a little stumped, and then find a schtick that might actually stick.</p><img alt="a hand with a watch" title="a hand with a watch" width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-1493-65f20831dcff9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Me</span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
