The list goes on. It can often feel overwhelming and nearly impossible to conquer all in the 365 days ahead. However, if there’s anything that could help kick off the new year and turn words into actions it’s getting organized. That’s why we spoke with </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>world-renowned tidying expert <a href=# id=auto-tag_marie-kondo data-tag=marie-kondo>Marie Kondo</a></span></a><span> to learn about how to set ourselves up for success in 2022.</span></p><h2>What are your New Year’s resolutions?</h2><p><span>We’ve always wondered what kinds of resolutions the Tidying Queen might have when she’s already so organized. Kondo says that her main goal for 2022 is “to bring joy to even more people’s lives through the KonMari Method.” For a quick refresher, the KonMari Method revolves around guidelines that help you only possess items that spark joy and truly bring meaning and necessity to your life.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><h2>What are your New Year’s rituals and traditions?</h2><p><span>“First, I write out my goals for the coming year using sumi ink and a brush. This activity is based on the ancient Japanese custom called kakizome,” says Kondo. Next up, Kondo and her family feast on a traditional, symbolic meal (called osechi ryori in Japan) that involves jubako, a set of stacked boxes filled with yummy eats. Perhaps the most surprising tradition is buying new underwear. “This is something that comes from the feng shui idea that what you wear on New Year’s Day will set the tone for the year ahead.”</span></p><h2>What tips would you give to someone who’s starting to tidy?</h2><p><span>“Don’t hesitate!” Kondo says. “I would recommend you to schedule your time to tidy and give yourself a deadline. ‘Someday’ will never come, unless you put it on your calendar!”</span></p><p><span>Kondo also recommends organizing your belongings by category and then figuring out which items to keep and which items to give away. “This will allow you to have an accurate grasp of how much actually needs to be stored. This method will then help you evaluate the type of organizing and storage solutions you will need in each particular space,” she says. Her </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>collaboration with The Container Store</span></a><span> offers a host of products that can assist in the process. There’s everything from kitchen canisters and hangers to desk organizers and baskets.</span></p><p><span>She also wants to make it clear that tidying isn’t just something you do here and there. Kondo suggests engaging in a tidying festival that incorporates the practice into everyday life. She put together </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>an eight-week challenge</span></a><span> and </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>a 10-lesson digital course</span></a><span> to help guide people who are just beginning their tidying journey.</span></p><h2>Which home trends are you predicting for 2022?</h2><p><span>Kondo believes indoor-outdoor living solutions and home office products will continue to thrive this year. “While I am not an interior designer by trade, I personally gravitate towards designs that are inspired by my other passion, gardening, so nature-inspired and sustainable materials,” she also predicts will be big this year. “In terms of color, I gravitate towards calming colors in soft tones that set the stage for reflection and relaxation.”</span></p><p><b>RELATED: </b><a href=# rel=noopener><b>Marie Kondo Reveals 5 Essential Home <a href=# id=auto-tag_organization data-tag=organization>Organization</a> Products That Spark Joy</b></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><span>On top of asking Kondo for advice, we of course had to get her top <a href=# id=auto-tag_home-organizing data-tag=home-organizing>home organizing</a> </span><span>product recommendations.
