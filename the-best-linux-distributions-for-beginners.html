You can then restart your computer and <a href=#>boot from the removable media</a> to use the Linux distribution in "live" mode. In live mode, the Linux distribution will run from the bootable device without tampering with your system.

It's a great Linux distribution to start with---and it's even a great Linux distribution to keep using after you're more experienced, if you're happy with it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Ubuntu?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ubuntu&nbsp;is user-friendly in a lot of ways. It offers a simple desktop and easy installer. It provides a checkbox during the installation process that will automatically install graphics drivers as well as&nbsp;<a href=#>various codecs you'd need for multimedia support</a>. There's an "Additional Drivers" tool that will detect closed-source drivers that might be necessary to get all your hardware working and easily install them for you.&nbsp;This additional software isn't always as easy to get on other Linux distributions.</p><p>Ubuntu's popularity means it has a large community that's willing to help. if you encounter a problem or have a question, you can generally search the web and you'll find someone else who's had the same problem or question along with an answer, because so many people use Ubuntu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ubuntu-software.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This huge community also means a lot of available software, both in Ubuntu's standard <a href=#>software repositories</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>third-party software repositories known as PPAs</a>. Third-party software vendors make sure they support Ubuntu.&nbsp;Applications like <a href=#>Google Chrome</a> and <a href=#>Microsoft Teams</a> officially support Ubuntu, while they may not be supported on smaller Linux distributions. Ubuntu offers an easy way to <a href=#>get the latest NVIDIA graphics drivers</a>&nbsp;if you like, while these can&nbsp;be more work to get&nbsp;on&nbsp;other Linux distributions.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Software Installation & Package Managers Work On Linux</a></span></p><p>You'll even get long-term support if you <a href=#>choose an "Long Term Support" (LTS)&nbsp;release, which we recommend</a>. LTS releases are supported with security updates for five years from their release date, and Ubuntu releases a new LTS version every two years. This means you'll only need to perform a major upgrade every two years, and you can hold off for five years if you prefer. Not all Linux distributions offer such long support times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ubuntu has had its share of controversy. In 2017, it upset some fans by announcing the <a href=#>abandonment of Ubuntu phone</a>, the vision of "convergence", and the new Unity 8 and Mir desktop and display server. But the project's abandoning of Unity 8 and Mir and future shift towards more standard Linux technologies like the GNOME desktop and Wayland display server means that Ubuntu should become even more rock-solid as it stops reinventing the wheel and builds on top of what the rest of the open source community is doing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lubuntu-desktop-application-menu.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ubuntu offers a variety of <a href=#>different "flavors"</a>, which come with different <a href=#>desktop environments</a> and applications over the same underlying Ubuntu operating system. You can use these to experiment with other desktop environments, while keeping the same base with its good technical support and software availability. For example, if you have an older computer you want to revive, you might want to give <a href=#>Lubuntu</a> a go (pictured above). It provides the LXQT desktop environment, which is much more <a href=#>lightweight</a> than the more full-featured desktop&nbsp;on Ubuntu.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 6 Best Lightweight Linux Distros</a></span></p><h2 id=linux-mint-offers-a-more-traditional-desktop>Linux Mint: Offers a More Traditional Desktop</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/linux-mint-202-uma-xfce-desktop.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Linux Mint</a> is extremely popular as well, and we can't recommend Ubuntu without noting that quite a few people <a href=#>prefer Linux Mint instead</a>. Linux Mint is based partially on Ubuntu, but uses the Cinnamon, MATE, or Xfce desktops instead. These are more traditional Linux desktop environments complete with a taskbar with a window list and pop-up applications menu. Quite a few people are just looking for a polished desktop that doesn't try to do anything new, and Linux Mint's Cinnamon and MATE desktops deliver this.</p><p>If that sounds what you want---or if you try Ubuntu and decide you'd prefer&nbsp;a more traditional desktop environment---look to Linux Mint.</p><p>Linux Mint <a href=#>used to be a bit more different from Ubuntu</a>, offering various <a href=#>media codecs</a> bundled for a more convenient user experience. But Ubuntu now makes those much easier to install, and Linux Mint installs them separately (but in a similarly easy way). And, since Mint is based on Ubuntu, you can still get a ton of applications and support for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fedora-all-about-bleeding-edge-open-source-software>Fedora: All About Bleeding Edge, Open Source Software</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fedora-linux-welcome.png><p>"Try Ubuntu or Mint" is pretty common advice. These&nbsp;are great&nbsp;Linux distributions to start with and learn. But, if you're looking for something a bit different, you might want to give Fedora a spin.</p><p><a href=#>Fedora</a> has a few philosophical differences from Ubuntu, Mint, and many other distributions. Unlike the others, Fedora is passionate about only including open-source software. It doesn't include closed-source hardware drivers, for example. You have to find those yourself after installation if you require them.</p><p>The Fedora developers&nbsp;also work more directly with open source projects like GNOME, making fewer changes and just shipping you the latest, bleeding-edge software from these projects. This distro gives you the latest and greatest stuff from the community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fedora's desktop image is now known as "Fedora Workstation" and pitches itself to developers who need to use Linux, providing easy access to development features and software. But it can be used by anyone.</p><p>This community Linux distribution also forms the base for <a href=#>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>, a commercial Linux product Red Hat provides long-term support for. Fedora is the opposite---the project releases new versions approximately every six months, and each release will be supported with security updates for approximately every thirteen months. You'll have to upgrade to at least every second release of Fedora to stay supported. If you want a free version of Red Hat's slower-moving Red Hat Enterprise Linux, use <a href=#>CentOS</a>&nbsp;instead. It's the same code as in RHEL, but without the branding and commercial support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-linux-distributions-you-might-want-to-try>Other Linux Distributions You Might Want to Try</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ElementaryOS6WebHTGCom.png><p>There are many other solid Linux distributions you can try.

Elementary OS offers a polished, simple desktop due to its own custom Pantheon desktop environment. It looks good and is quite different from many other Linux desktops, but may not be as rock-solid and supported as tried-and-tested distributions. Elementary's website asks for a donation before you download it, but you can enter "$0" if you just want to download it for free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/debian-11-bullseye-gnome-desktop.png><p><a href=#>Debian</a> is a great Linux distribution and actually forms the basis for Ubuntu, which in turn forms the base for many other Linux distributions.
