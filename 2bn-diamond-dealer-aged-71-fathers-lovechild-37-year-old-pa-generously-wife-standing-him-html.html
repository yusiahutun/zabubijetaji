diamond tycoon Laurence Graff has fathered a lovechild at the age of 71 – with a former employee 34 years his junior.<br></p><p>The Mail on Sunday understands that the wealthy businessman’s wife Anne Marie intends to stick by him – even though she filed for divorce earlier this year.<br></p><p>At the last minute, she dramatically cancelled legal proceedings, which could have led to Britain’s largest ever divorce settlement.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/18/article-1221198-025773AE000005DC-784_468x728.jpg height=728 width=468 alt="Josephine Daniel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The mistress: Josephine Daniel has been having an on-and-off affair with jewel tycoon, Laurence Graff, for nine years. Pictured with her pampered pooch Daisy</p><p>We can now disclose that Laurence’s mistress, brunette jeweller Josephine Daniel, 37, was pregnant at the time, and gave birth to their daughter in July.<br></p><p>Mr Graff, a self-made mogul worth an estimated £2.2billion, is understood to be looking after the girl financially.<br></p><p>One society insider said: ‘This baby has been an open secret in London society circles for months. Laurence is trying to do the honourable thing. He is very proud to be a father at his age, and he plans to look after Josephine and his daughter.’<br></p><p>The Graffs – who have been married for 47 years – were both at a charity event in London last week, where they were said to be relaxed in each other’s presence.<br></p><p>‘It might seem to be an unusual situation to many people, but it’s not unusual for a family like the Graffs to have mistresses,’ said a friend.<br></p><p>‘Laurence has been having an affair with Josephine on and off for nine years.<br></p><p>‘He and Anne Marie seem to be very much together and were very happy in one another’s company on Monday. Of course, Anne Marie is aware of the baby.’<br></p><p>Laurence met Josephine in 1999 in London nightclub China White, according to friends, and she subsequently worked as his assistant at the Graff store in Bond Street.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/17/article-1221198-06DB7AF3000005DC-686_468x645.jpg height=645 width=468 alt="Forgiving: Anne Marie is standing by husband Laurence Graff" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Forgiving: Anne Marie is standing by husband Laurence Graff</p><p>They travelled the world together – visiting New York and Monte Carlo – and Laurence fell for her. In March this year, ‘the divorce that never was’ made headlines when, moments before London’s High Court was set to issue the decree nisi, the hearing was adjourned.<br></p><p>The Graffs issued a statement saying: ‘Mr and Mrs Graff deny that they are, or have any intention of, getting divorced.’<br></p><p>At the time it was not known that Laurence had resumed his relationship with Josephine, who had become pregnant.<br></p><p>‘Laurence is well known for having a twinkle in his eye but he loves his wife and has no intention of ever divorcing her,’ said a source.<br></p><p>‘He has made no secret of his surprise, even delight, at becoming a father again. People have been congratulating him and he’s not appeared too unhappy at it all.<br>In fact, he smiles when asked about it.<br></p><p>‘He is 71 now but still keeps himself in shape and prides himself on acting and looking like a man much younger than his years.<br></p><p>‘He is obviously fit enough to father a child with a brunette almost half his age. The feeling among most of his male friends is, “Good for him!”<br></p><p>‘Obviously he will look after Josephine and the baby financially.’<br></p><p>Graff, who has been dubbed ‘The King of Bling’ and ‘The Lord of the Rings’, has two sons – Francois, 44, who runs the London branch of his father’s business empire, and Stephane, 43, a successful artist – as well as a daughter, 29-year-old Kristelle, all with Anne Marie, 71.<br></p><p>The jeweller counts Elizabeth Taylor, Donald Trump and the Sultan of Brunei among his clients and friends.<br></p><p>A self-made man, he left school at 14 and cleaned toilets before becoming an apprentice jeweller in London’s Hatton Garden. He is now Britain’s tenth wealthiest man and owns luxury homes in London, Switzerland, France and New York.<br></p><p>He has a private jet, a 150ft yacht, two sprawling vineyards in South Africa and a stake in a major South African diamond mine.<br></p><p>He also has a legendary art collection which includes an Andy Warhol painting of Elizabeth Taylor called ‘Red Liz’, valued at £35million.<br></p><p>Last December he bought the 35-carat Wittelsbach Diamond for £15million, the most ever paid for a diamond at auction.<br></p><p>London-born Josephine is the daughter of former Royal Shakespeare Company director Ronald Daniel, 67, and his actress wife Anjula, 64. The couple later divorced and Ronald now works as a freelance director in New York.<br></p><p>Inheriting her parents’ creative abilities, Josephine trained as a gemologist at Kingston University in Surrey. She was rewarded with a Fellowship to the Gemological Association 12 years ago before specialising in antique jewellery. She continued her training at Cartier before moving to Graff.<br></p><p>In an earlier interview with The Mail on Sunday, she revealed one of her greatest extravagances: organic pet food for her dachshund Daisy.<br></p><p>She admitted spending £150 on a dog car seat and another £50 for a set of steps to allow Daisy to walk up on to her bed.<br></p><p>A source said: ‘She’s a nice girl who would never have gone public with this because Laurence has been good to her. And she loves him. They have known each other for years. She was in awe of him and then she fell in love with him.’</p><p><span style=font-style:italic>Additional reporting: Keri Sutherland</span><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc36QanBxZ2KXu26wyJqkqKaUYrGmrcueqWaZl5qxboOQZp2arJiav7R5y6itnpuYnrmleZJwZLKdkad6sLjDZod6ZV1itKa6xKumrqucrnq4tcWeZKyskaOxqrrGZp%2BipV6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./asian-stars-racial-controversies-awkwafinas-blaccent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Asian stars in racial controversies: from Awkwafinas blaccent scandal to Real Housewives of</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./we-compared-video-distribution-pricing-so-you-dont-have-to.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>We Compared Video Distribution Pricing (So You Dont Have To)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
