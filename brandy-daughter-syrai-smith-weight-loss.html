She also told the daytime hosts that her desire to prioritize her health and her mother's support were the two biggest driving forces that kept her going.</p><p>"I had a lot of health issues when I was at the size that I was," Smith revealed. "My mom was with me through everything. She saw me go through a lot. And I just decided to really take my health seriously, so I changed my mindset, changed my mentality, and I knew that being in the size or the body that I was in, I knew my life wasn't going to be as long ... I just knew that living my purpose, I wouldn't be able to live in that body."</p><p>She admitted that despite the loving environment she grew up in, her size always made her feel like "the odd one out."</p><p>"Sometimes it was a little bit difficult because seeing my mom dress a certain way or wear certain things, or when she was on the carpet or anything like that, it was kind of difficult because I was like, 'Why am I not that way?' she confessed.</p><p>Although her mother always reminded her of her beauty both inside and out, she often wondered, "Why am I not that size, why was I made the way I was made? And sometimes I would feel a little sad or feel like she was embarrassed of me."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a2/4by3/2021/11/18/a2e2a062dc0a451696b372a0482dd471_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">The Real/Sy'Rai Smith</span><p>Sy'Rai also spoke out about how social media made her obsess over her progress and became a place where she would constantly compare herself to other women.</p><p>"I started becoming a little more obsessed with the scale, with how I looked, with how my body was transforming. It wasn't easy to look at myself and then I grow up in an era where a lot of young women compare themselves to other women on social media," she said.</p><p>"I'm a victim of that, I get very jealous and very insecure when I look at other women and I know my body has been through a lot and I always have to remind myself of that," she continued.</p><p>"The scars I have, the stretch marks that I have ... it's for a purpose ... but I do feel a little pressure," she continued. "People have eyes on me at all times ... I did feel pressure to quickly do it or maneuver to kind of form a little Instagram body but that's not normal."</p><p>Her mother Brandy showed support for her daughter's first television appearance on Instagram after it aired -- writing, "What an amazing human being I love your spirit and your smile. So brave to walk in your purpose and shine in your truth all up on @therealdaytime Your smile …. @syraismith #inspire."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><a id=gallery-link-d4ce9400-f5aa-5313-a13b-6c9218083841 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:d4ce9400-f5aa-5313-a13b-6c9218083841 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20210610_21c3db517bf340998aad1e06a05a686d data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:a9ae8b88-2986-4f4e-a5e3-8e13507cee72 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/21/4by3/2021/06/10/21c3db517bf340998aad1e06a05a686d_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGpmanBfl7%2BiusOyZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZqqyqpGeerS5yK2fZq%2BVnrSpwIylpqyrXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-sheer-veil-stockings-baby-bar-exam-vogue-hong-kong.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Posed in Nothing But a Sheer Veil and Stockings</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./article-e3d2136c-e874-11ed-9013-670f0a22a04b-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Band of Braves to march in Dublin, Ireland | High School</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
