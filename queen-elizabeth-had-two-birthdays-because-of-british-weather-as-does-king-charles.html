However, her special day wouldn’t actually have been ‘officially’ celebrated by the public today as her official celebrations took place in June, at Trooping the Color.</strong></p><p>Trooping The Color takes place on a Saturday in June. <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>‘s last was held on Thursday 2 June, as part of the <a href=#>royal</a> Platinum Jubilee celebrations, three months <a href=#>before her death</a>. Over 1400 parading soldiers, 200 horses, and 400 musicians come together each June to display military precision and for over 200 years, to mark the Sovereign’s official birthday. That date was picked, simply because of the (hopefully) nice weather. Yep, that’s right. Good old British weather.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1400675098-814x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-queen-elizabeth-had-two-birthdays-and-where-the-tradition-started>Why Queen Elizabeth had two birthdays – and where the ‘tradition’ started</h2><p>If you live in Britain, this reasoning is completely understandable. If not, we’ll explain. The tradition of celebrating the monarch’s birthday in June started back in 1748 with King George II, who was born in November 1683.</p><p>Of course, the monarch rightly wanted a big event for the public to join, but an outdoor celebration in November in the UK was a big no, due to the chilly weather. The annual Trooping the Colour parade was held in June, and before this was strictly a military event. Regiments would display their flags and colors so soldiers could familiarize themselves.</p><p>King George II then merged his birthday celebrations with the annual event, and ever since then, all all British monarchs have had the option of the “official birthday.” As Queen Elizabeth II’s birthday is in spring, which can still be chilly in the UK, she also opted for June as a ‘safer’ option.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>King Charles</a> will be following in the footsteps, as like King George II, Charles was born in November. November 14, 1948, to be precise. Of course, an outdoor celebration in Britain is a no-go at this freezing time, so he also ‘officially’ celebrates during Trooping the Color.</p><p>As for upcoming monarchs, <a href=#>Prince William</a>‘s birthday falls on 21 June. If he upholds the Trooping tradition when he’s King, he’ll be the first monarch since his great-grandfather, King Charles VI, to celebrate his actual birthday in the same month as his official birthday parade. Or it could so happen that the event is moved to line up with his birthday.</p><p><a href=#>Prince George</a>‘s birthday is on July 22, once again a summer birthday. Therefore, it will be interesting to see how things pan out in the future.</p><p>This year, the event will be held on Saturday, June 15.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sarah-ferguson-shares-birthday-message-to-remember-late-queen>Sarah Ferguson shares birthday message to remember late Queen</h2><p>Sarah Ferguson, who was previously married to Prince Andrew, has taken to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to pay tribute to the Queen on what would have been her 98th birthday. However, she mistakingly wrote 97th, which many fans noticed in the comments.</p><p>“Today we are remembering Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on what would have been her 97th birthday,” the Duchess of York wrote. “Thank you for all that you have taught us, for being a steadfast leader and dear friend. You are sorely missed.”</p><p>Fergie recently announced she had been <a href=#>diagnosed with skin cancer</a>, following her diagnosis with an early form of <a href=#>breast cancer last summer</a>.</p><p>It is thought the rest of the royal family will celebrate the former monarch’s birthday ‘privately’.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2d%2BcL3UnpynZZWhtrutwZ6roWWYlrFuwNaoZJuhoqm1pa3YrGSbnZOWwrSxjKidZpqinsGqv8dmrp6ZpJ2ys3nArGSdp5Woeqy1zaBknKCRp7mmv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-panic-at-disco-break-up.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did Panic! at the Disco Break Up?
