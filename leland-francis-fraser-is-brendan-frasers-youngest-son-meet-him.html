They ensured Leland and his siblings lived a sheltered and private life while growing up.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not to say that they have not experienced the perks of fame and fortune thanks to their parents. Most of what Leland has accomplished is believed to be thanks to his ties to his parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here is all we know about him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/brr-fotor-2023072862731.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Leland_Francis_Fraser></span>Who Is Leland Francis Fraser?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Leland Francis Fraser is Brendan and Smith’s youngest son. He was born May 2, 2006, at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.&nbsp;Leland is a fashion model and is reportedly repped by Marilyn Agency NY. However, he is also said to enjoy music even though it is unclear if he will pursue a career.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s a member of the band known as “The Alligators” and is known to share videos of him singing and playing guitar on his Instagram page now and again.&nbsp;Leland prefers to fly under the radar. However, in November 2022, he made a rare public appearance at the New York premiere of “The Whale” alongside his father and brother Holden.</p><p>Leland has a close bond with his father and brothers, which has been showcased several times.&nbsp;During an appearance on “The Rachael Ray Show” in February 2010, his father described him as “a professional fire plug.”&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “He goes through brushes and briers and comes out on the other side scratched and smiling. It’s all good!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Leland_Francis_Frasers_Parents></span>Leland Francis Fraser’s Parents&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born to Brendan and Afton.&nbsp;Brendan is an actor famous for his roles both on the big screen and on TV. He graduated from the Cornish College of the Arts in 1990 and rose to fame after starring in “Dogfight” in 1991.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/breff.jpg><p>After his breakout role, Brendan became more famous after securing roles in hit movies, including “George of the Jungle.”&nbsp;His former wife, Leland’s mother, is an American actress. She was born in Northport, Long Island, New York, USA.&nbsp;</p><p>Her career in acting kicked off in 1987, and since then, she has become famous for starring in movies, including “George of the Jungle,” “Fried Green Tomatoes,” and “Reality Bites.”&nbsp;The couple met in 1993, just as Brendan’s career kicked off. The meeting happened during an Independence Day barbecue hosted by Winona Ryder.&nbsp;</p><p>Brendan and Afton dated for four years before they eventually tied the knot on September 27, 1998. They were together for about a decade before finally calling it quits in 2008. Their union was blessed with three sons before it ended.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time of their split, Leland was just a toddler. The reason for their separation is unknown, but Brendan was ordered to pay $50,000 monthly for ten years in alimony and $25,000 monthly for child support.&nbsp;</p><p>They also had a legal battle over financial assets but remained committed to co-parenting their children through it all.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Leland_Francis_Frasers_Height></span>Leland Francis Fraser’s Height&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brendan Fraser’s youngest stands 6 feet 3 inches, or 191 centimeters.

He said fatherhood teaches him “how to love more and more every day.”</p><p><a href=#>Brendan Fraser </a>takes his job as a dad very seriously.
