The couple previously tied the knot on Dec. 23, 2004. Leslie was first married to Nancy Wiesenfeld from 1978 until she filed for divorce in 2003.</p><p>However, in recent months, Les has been under fire after six women accused him of sexual harassment in a July article written by Ronan Farrow. And on Sunday, Sept. 9, he announced he’d be leaving the network after six more women spoke out about his behavior in a new exposé on him in the New Yorker also written by Ronan Farrow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/julie-chen-leslie-moonves.jpg><p>“For the past 24 years it has been an incredible privilege to lead CBS’s renaissance and transformation into a leading global media company. The best part of this journey has been working alongside the dedicated and talented people in this company. Together, we built CBS into a destination where the best in the business come to work and succeed,” he said in a statement yesterday. “Untrue allegations from decades ago are now being made against me that are not consistent with who I am. &nbsp;Effective immediately I will no longer be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CBS. I am deeply saddened to be leaving the company. I wish nothing but the best for the organization, the newly comprised board of directors and all of its employees.”</p><p>In July, after the first news originally broke, Julie <a href=# rel=dofollow>issued a statement</a>, which proved she was standing by her husband’s side amid the allegations.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have known my husband, Leslie Moonves, since the late ’90s, and I have been married to him for almost 14 years. Leslie is a good man and a loving father, devoted husband and inspiring corporate leader,” Julie tweeted. “He has always been a kind, decent, and moral human being. I fully support my husband and stand behind him and his statement.”</p><p>During The Talk on Monday, July 30, she revealed she would not be addressing the issue any further. “Some of you may be aware of what’s been going on in my life the past few days,” she shared. “I issued the one and only statement I will ever make on this topic on Twitter. And I will stand by that statement today, tomorrow, forever.”</p><p>Julie has not yet spoken out about her husband resigning from the network.&nbsp;</p><h2>Does Julie Chen have kids?</h2><p>Julie and Leslie welcomed their son, Charlie Moonves, 8, on Sept. 24, 2009. Leslie also has three other kids from his previous marriage: sons Michael and Adam and daughter Sara.</p><h2>What is Julie Chen’s net worth?</h2><p>Julie has been said to have a net worth of $16 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. So impressive! What’s even more impressive? Her hubby Leslie’s reported net worth is $300 million. Talk about a power couple!</p><h2>How tall is Julie Chen?</h2><p>Julie is 5’5″! Hard to tell from your TV screen, right?</p><h2>What does Julie Chen look like with no makeup?</h2><p>Still pretty, of course! In 2012, Julie appeared on The Talk totally bare-faced as part of a <a href=#>no makeup episode</a> with all of her co-hosts. However, Julie is known for wearing a lot of makeup during her shows, so it’s always a treat to see her au naturale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/julie-chen-no-makeup.jpg><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julie wearing no makeup on The Talk. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><h2>Has Julie Chen gotten plastic surgery?</h2><p>In the past, Julie has <a href=#>admitted to getting a Blepharoplasty </a>when she was 25 after a previous boss suggested she try to look “less Chinese.” “No one’s more proud of being Chinese than I am,” she told her co-hosts on The Talk. “And I have to live with the decisions I’ve made. Every decision I’ve made…it got [me] to where we are today, and I’m not going to look back.”</p><h2>Is Julie Chen pregnant?</h2><p>Julie is not pregnant as far as we know, however, she’s the one who spilled the beans of George Clooney and Amal Clooney’s pregnancy on The Talk back in 2016!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jrKWhlWKwqbHNZp%2Buq5KWu6V5y56qpaGVYrqwu82vnKxlYWiFen%2BWaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kitten-heels-how-to-wear-them-and-which-ones-to-buy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'2024 is the year of the kitten heel' - Heres how to wear them and which ones to shop now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-heidi-klums-husband-inside-marriage-to-tom-kaulitz.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Heidi Klums Husband?
