It is in a pink leather case, also with E.R. on it, and there was a note from the Queen. No words can describe how thrilled I am.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Saturday, December 2</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Taxied round [from Claridge’s hotel in London] to Charles Street [for] a sort of cocktail party [that] went on as a dance upstairs to a radiogram.

She was invited to her wedding and, although Alathea moved to Switzerland, the friends met occasionally for lunch.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1999, she gave a small cocktail party in her sister’s Knightsbridge flat for the Queen — serving M&S frozen canapés. This would have been perfectly all right, had Alathea thought to thaw them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A few months before she died from a brain tumour in 2001, she went to a ball at Windsor Castle.
