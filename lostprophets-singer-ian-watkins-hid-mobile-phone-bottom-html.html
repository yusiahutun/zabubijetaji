Lostprophets fan, and they began an 'on off' relationship until 2012.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2016, after Watkins had been jailed for sex offences, she began to write to him in prison, and he would write back and phone her from an official prison phone.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She told the court that in a letter a few months before he began texting her he addressed her her as 'Gabriella-Ella-Ella-eh-eh-eh', a reference to&nbsp;the Rihanna song 'Umbrella'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said the first text from a mobile phone she did not recognise on March 5 called her my that name. 'I said who is this?' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Watkins replied: 'It's the devil on your shoulder.' He also added: 'I'm trusting you massively with this.'&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/03/16/16847946-0-image-m-55_1564846534517.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>A$AP Rocky rocks a Gucci headscarf as he arrives back in US...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/05/11/16901730-0-image-m-46_1564999269967.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>'Possessive and controlling' thug, 25, is jailed for three...</span></a></li><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/01/15/16771090-0-image-m-14_1564668883605.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>I didn't want to miss out, and I thought f**k it': Hatton...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>They spoke twice for about 10 minutes and voice calls and exchanged further text messages over the following few days before Miss Persson researched the legality of prisoners having mobile phones in their cells.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I discovered that I could potentially get into trouble for speaking to him on the phone,' she told the jury of nine men and three women.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She phoned the prison to report Watkins and deleted the text messages.
