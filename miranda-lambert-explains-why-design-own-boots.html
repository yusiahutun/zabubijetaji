The fiery songstress took matters into her own hands, launching Miranda by Miranda Lambert for DSW. Now, she details whether she thinks she'll become a full-time designer, and where the future is headed for her line.</p><p>Fans were super excited to find out they could don shoes specifically designed by the 'Mama's Broken Heart' hitmaker herself when the<a href=#> announcement&nbsp;</a>came in December 2013, with the description of shoes “beyond all expectations with just the right combination of edgy and feminine.”</p><p>Lambert delves into the details of launching the line, telling <a href=#>Footwear News</a>, “I had this pair of boots that I absolutely loved. The style was really hard to come by, and I literally wore off the soles on stage." She adds, “I kept thinking about getting my own boot line because you just couldn’t find them.”</p><p>Although a shoe line is certainly a lot to add to her plate in addition to her <a href=#>Pink Pistol stores</a>, she's adamant about focusing on her No. 1 love: country music.</p><p>"I haven’t worried too much about [entering the fashion world]. I’m a singer-songwriter first and foremost, so knowing that I have a great foundation and career, I wanted this to be fun. With the boots and shoes, I get inspired by the music and, if I have that, it all falls into place."</p><p>Lambert showed off the sleek silver boots she designed at the 2014 CMAs when she <a href=#>performed</a> 'We Were Us' with country superstar <a href=#>Keith Urban</a>.</p><p>As for her future in fashion design, Lambert elaborates, "... I want it to grow organically. The longer we’re out there, the better the product will be, too. I want people to wear the shoes and have to buy another pair because they’ve worn the shoes so much. There are definitely possibilities, though. We’re starting with shoes and would love to have handbags or belts. But we need a strong foundation in the beginning with boots and shoes."</p><p><strong>Everything You Need to Know About Miranda Lambert's New Album</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqGilrulrYylmKaalafBbrHXqaOaoZ6oeri02GabnquZnLtuu9anZJunn6nAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oprah-winfrey-unseen-childhood-pictures.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Oprah Winfrey shares amazing unseen childhood pictures as she launches new series The Hair Tales</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-sheer-veil-stockings-baby-bar-exam-vogue-hong-kong.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Posed in Nothing But a Sheer Veil and Stockings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
