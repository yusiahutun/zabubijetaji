According to one of two origin stories (the other involving an adult novelty doll called Bild Lilli, handed out at bachelor parties), Handler noticed her daughter Barbara playing with paper dolls and decided she wanted to give her a doll that was not a baby, but a woman she could aspire to. Barbie, named after her daughter, was born and she premiered at the annual Toy Fair in New York in March 1959. In the first year, 300,000 Barbie dolls were sold.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She was ‘petite’ as the advert chimes, with all the latest clothes and accessories. Among these was, of course, a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/bazaar-brides/g43561651/bridal-shops/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wedding dress" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wedding dress</a>. Her immediate MO was clearly as a stylish and sophisticated style maven, the kind of svelte, pretty woman young girls wanted to be – at least in 1959. Her first ever outfit – as exemplified in Gerwig’s initial teaser trailer for the Barbie movie – was a black and white swimsuit, with white heels and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/a44426565/barbie-white-framed-sunglasses/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="white-rimmed sunglasses" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">white-rimmed sunglasses</a>. Unsurprisingly, by 1961, she was ‘going steady’ with Ken (oddly named after the Handlers’ son).</p><img alt="barbie film casting" title="Barbie film casting" width=3300 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/28/1499852903-barbie.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">getty images</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Barbie: Official Teaser Trailer (Warner Bros.

To counteract this, the Handlers gave her a little sister, Skipper (originally a child and now sold as a teenager), and a best friend, Midge – who would go to have her own chequered history. Fashioned as a ‘homelier’ friend for Barbie (with red hair and freckles) Midge would disappear after 1967, returning in the 1980s along with a husband, kids and a ‘Happy Family Line’ of toys, which even included Pregnant Midge (with a detachable womb!). The line courted scandal from every angle – among which was outrage that Midge was pregnant without a wedding ring. Cannily, Gerwig has lined up <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/a24209338/emerald-fennell-actress-playing-camilla-the-crown-season-3/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emerald Fennell" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emerald Fennell</a> to play Midge. Yes, Pregnant Midge.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though to many Barbie was too conventional – with her improbable proportions and origins as a doll who aspires to, essentially, marry Ken – to many she was too progressive. Indeed, as early as 1968, nine years after Barbie’s invention, Mattel introduced their first Black doll, Christie, a friend of Barbie. Christie arrived at a fecund point in American politics, just as the Civil Rights Act of 1968 – enshrining the illegality of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a33293667/diana-evans-george-floyd/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="racial discrimination" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">racial discrimination</a> – was passed.</p><img alt="barbie dolls" title="Barbie dolls" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/25/1498217689-bb-fash17-photogroup-01-16-9-webuseonly.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtsey Mattel</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It would not be until 1980, however, that Mattel would produce its first Black Barbie. She was designed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.insider.com/barbie-kitty-black-perkins-designer-diversity-mattel-dolls-2023-4#in-1979-black-perkins-who-had-become-barbies-principal-designer-the-year-before-was-tasked-with-creating-an-outfit-for-the-first-ever-black-barbie-shes-black-shes-beautiful-shes-dynamite-the-dolls-box-said-6 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kitty Black Perkins," class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kitty Black Perkins,</a> who was then chief designer for Barbie. She bought her first Barbie doll aged 28, when interviewing for the position, when she was asked to create a whole new wardrobe for the doll. She was chief designer for more than 30 years and, in 1979, she was asked to design the first ever Black Barbie. When she arrived, she was wearing a red disco jumpsuit and came with the tagline: "She's Black! She's beautiful! She's dynamite!”</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Barbie and feminism</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If many were concerned that Barbie was too ‘sexy,’ there were true concerns amongst the feminist movement – which took on a whole new momentum in the 1960s and 1970s – that Barbie was an anti-feminist role model; a doll created (especially if we consider the alternative origin story) as a male, not a female, fantasy. Quickly, Barbie had become a shorthand for bimbo, for a sort of man-pleasing vapidity that Second Wave <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a44027567/shiv-roy-succession-finale/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Feminists class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Feminists</a> took issue with. Indeed, at a 1970 Women’s Strike for Equality march in New York, the chant became “I am not a Barbie doll”.</p><img alt="barbie flight attendant" title="barbie flight attendant" width=1200 height=1800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/10/1457604975-hbz-barbie-exhibit-05-flight-attendent-1961.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Les Arts Decoratifs Museum/Mattel</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yet Barbie was already a working woman.

By 1992. ‘Business Executive Barbie’ had snagged herself a corner office and that same year, she made her first bid for President. Fun fact: Barbie has run for president every election since. She has also, since 1959, held more than 250 careers – from dentist to Olympic skier.

Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.”</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>Barbie and body image</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If there is one unswerving commentary about Barbie, it is the unrealistic proportions of her figure. Impossibly nipped-in waist, generous boobs and unbendable legs which, famously, would never be able to support Barbie’s frame in reality. Beyond the fact that she is ludicrously appointed, it is the message this sends to young girls that has always caused concern. How impossible would it be to look like Barbie, and, equally, how depressing when you look nothing like her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, the doll has historically propagated an unrealistic body type, and worrying messages. A 1963 Barbie came complete with a diet book that simply read ‘Don’t eat’. In 2006, a study published in the journal of Developmental Psychology concluded that girls exposed to Barbie at a young age were more vocal about being thin, compared with those exposed to other dolls.</p><img alt="barbie body types" title="Barbie body types" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/04/1454003169-barbie-body-types.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtsey Mattel</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Evelyn Mazzocco, head of the Barbie brand, undertook a poll of ‘Barbie haters’ shortly after she took over in 2014. She wanted to see why it was that the world’s most loved and hated doll drew such derision. The most common responses were ‘out of touch,’ ‘materialistic’ and ‘not diverse’. She told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/barbie-new-body-cover-story/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Time magazine" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Time magazine</a> that year that she regularly received hate mail, and even death threats, about Barbie’s body. Then, in 2016, three new body shapes were introduced to Barbie: petite, tall and curvy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, there are myriad other body types to consider. The first Barbie doll in a wheelchair was released in 1997, though she was ‘Becky’ and not Barbie. It was not until 2019 that there was a full range of Barbie dolls with prosthetic limbs and wheelchairs. In April of this year, Mattel released its first ever Barbie with Down Syndrome.</p><img alt="dua lipa barbie manicure" title="dua lipa barbie manicure" width=2034 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1539542821-64afc935a42af.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Samir Hussein</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Margot Robbie at the London premiere of Barbie</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>The legacy of Barbie</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to the most recent statistics, three Barbie dolls are sold every second.
