The result was four very different spaces, and Kristina Crestin from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a43523277/hgtv-farmhouse-fixer-jonathan-knight-season-3/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Farmhouse Fixer" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Farmhouse Fixer</a> had the difficult task of judging.</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">'Rock the Block' Season 5</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Lyndsay and Leslie created a spa-like bathroom complete with a sauna, a closet with floor-to-ceiling storage and a shoe spinner, and a balcony with a cold plunge pool. Kristina was impressed by the upscale feel and layered textures. She questioned the cold plunge ("not my cup of tea") and thought that the counter area in the bedroom felt more hotel-like. But she complimented the "brilliant" closet and called the bathroom a sanctuary. Kristina said the twins' space hit the "amenity mark" more than any other team.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Page and Mitch wanted to make the most of the room's waterfront view with a platform bed facing the expansive windows. They embraced the spacious bathroom and used Moroccan plaster and added archways, and they aimed for an unforgettable closet complete with a Champagne bar. The biggest surprise? An outdoor shower on the second-floor balcony. Kristina praised the bedroom and loved that the bed faced the water, plus she said that the bathroom had a true vacation feel, although she questioned the pink countertop. Her one critique: The closet didn't feel as elevated as what she saw in the other homes.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Keith and Evan continued their organic modern theme in the primary suite. They opened up the door for an unencumbered view and went over-the-top in their closet with a seating area, secret door to a laundry room, and fireplace. Kristina said their main suite was casual and inviting and praised the flow of the space. She called their closet "fairly epic" but wondered if the frill would've been better used in the bedroom. Her main hang-up seemed to be the linen closet in the bathroom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Sarah and Bryan took a big risk by swapping the bedroom and bathroom in the layout to make better use of the square footage. They decided to splurge on the reconfiguration and add new windows and save on their balcony and smaller closet. They got high marks for the luxurious space and their use of colors and textures. Kristina thought the closet was a little small. She loved the well-appointed bathroom with its high-tech shower but questioned the faux planter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">After touring all of the homes, Kristina determined the winner of the $3,000 prize to be Page and Mitch! This is the team's second win of the season. HGTV shared the news with a post on Instagram, and they were met with a flood of comments, many joining in to share their excitement for Page and Mitch's design:</p><ul data-node-id=11 class="css-9wvcvc et3p2gv0"><li>"Page & Mitch my pick! So happy they won!"<br></li><li>"Page and Mitch - mic üé§ drop moment!!! This was the bedroom of my dreams! Congrats on this big win‚ù£Ô∏è"</li><li>"That entire space was STUNNING!!! The elevated bed, facing the water was perfection!!!!! The outdoor shower was spectacular. The bedroom, the bathroom, the pops of that pink/soft rose color were so refreshing. Loved it!!"</li></ul><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Others were disappointed by Kristina's choice and questioned the platform bed and outdoor shower:</p><ul data-node-id=14 class="css-9wvcvc et3p2gv0"><li>"Loved Bryan and Sarah‚Äôs rooms. Why would you want an outdoor shower taking up space on your balcony?! Your ensuite is only steps away. Makes no sense to me."</li><li>"I like Paige and Mitch but this was not it for me and I was absolutely baffled by their win‚Ä¶ The only good choice they made was having the bed face the water‚Ä¶"</li><li>"Keith and Evan keep getting robbed! They are the only ones that have made use of all the space on a luxury level."</li><li>"It‚Äôs pretty but how do you get in and out of that bed? I just think the function of the bed and the platform is dangerous. It‚Äôs the first thing I would rip out if I bought this place."</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">What did you think of this week's episode?
