In fact, he is one of the three best players in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p><p>Before marrying Kareem, Habiba used a different name but changed it to marry Kareem. Nevertheless, the former couple’s wedding could not last long, but they had three children. In addition, Habiba’s parents could not attend her wedding and were denied entry to the mosque.</p><p>What was the reason why Habib’s mum and dad were denied entry to the mosque? Why did the then-husband and wife part ways? Is she married to a second husband? For all the details about Habiba Abdul-Jabbar, read the article below. Also find out about her age, birthday, education, love life, net worth, and much more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Kareem’s Wife, Habiba Abdul-Jabbar? Her Birth Details</strong></h2><p>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s wife Habiba is a fashion designer who was born Janice Brown. She was born in October 1947, so she will be 75 years old in 2022, although her exact date of birth has not been revealed. She is a US citizen and of white ethnicity.</p><p>As Habiba Abdul-Jabbar has not disclosed many details about her early life, information about her childhood is still behind closed curtains. Nevertheless, we know that she is the only child of her parents and followed Christianity in her formal years but then converted to Islam because of her ex-husband Kareem.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Her Education</strong></h2><p>She attended California State University in Los Angeles to obtain a degree. She successfully completed her education and obtained a diploma. However, Habiba has not disclosed her year of graduation.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Julie Rose Clapton: Inside The Life Of Eric Clapton’s Daughter</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Where Is Habiba Abdul-Jabbar From?</strong></h2><p>As many tabloids have claimed that Habiba’s parents are from New York, her original address is probably from there. However, after her marriage, she moved to her ex-husband’s house in Washington with her ex-husband Kareem.</p><p>Habiba Abdul-Jabbar currently lives with her family in View Park, Los Angeles, California.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Habiba Abdul-Jabbar’s Parents Couldn’t Attend Her Marriage</strong></h2><p>The fashion designer and her former partner exchanged vows on 28 May 1971 in a private wedding ceremony at the Washington Mosque. Although her marriage was attended by close friends and family members of both parties, Jabbar’s parents were not allowed to enter the mosque.</p><p>Although Habiba changed her name from Janice Brown and her religious affiliation to Muslim, her mother and father were not allowed to attend her wedding. They traveled all the way from New York just to see the wedding of their only child but were prevented from doing so because of their Catholic faith. This somehow caused a rift between Habib’s family and her husband’s family.</p><p>As Habib’s ex-husband had also just converted to the Muslim faith, even he had no idea about the practice. So even Kareem must have felt bad about it. After this incident, Kareem always tried to mention his relatives whenever he appeared on national television. He used to say: “Hello to Mum and Dad in New York.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What was the Reason behind Habiba’s Divorce from her Ex-Husband?</strong></h2><p>The union between Habib and her ex-husband Kareem did not last long. The couple parted ways after only a few years of marriage. Moreover, sources report that they lived apart for a short time soon after the marriage.</p><p>While the duo was married, Kareem was studying at Harvard. Sometime later, the couple had their first child and he was unable to devote time to his family. For this reason, Habiba divorced her then-lover in 1973. Later, the former lovers were separated in a religious ceremony, and in 1978, at Kareem’s request, they officially broke off their engagement.</p><p>The former basketball player also reportedly had a girlfriend named Cheryl Pistino, which influenced their divorce. Kareem then married the same girl, Cheryl, after divorcing his ex-wife Habiba.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Habiba Abdul-Jabbar Has Three Children with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</strong></h2><p>When she was married to Kareem, the 75-year-old had one daughter. However, the former couple did not stop having children after their divorce. As a result, Habiba gave birth to two more children after her divorce from her then-husband.</p><p>Her eldest son is Habiba Alcindor, born in 1972. Four years later, in 1976, she welcomed her second son, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Jr. Finally, her third and youngest daughter, Sultana Abdul-Jabbar, was born in 1979. She raised all these children as a single mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who is Habiba’s Second Husband?</strong></h2><p>As Kareem’s ex-wife is not active on social networks, information about her personal life is scarce. She is away from the public eye and does not want the media to interfere in her life at the moment.</p><p>However, we have learned that she married her second husband, Mr. Herbert, after divorcing the former NBA player. Eventually, she also had a child with him named Sean Herbert.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>What Happened To Hann Pan?

She also worked as an adoption specialist at Vista Del Mar from February 2008 to October 2012.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth Of Habiba Abdul-Jabbar</strong></h2><p>Although she was active in her career, her total assets have not yet been disclosed.
