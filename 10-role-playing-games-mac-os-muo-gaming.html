And while Windows still enjoys the biggest market share, times are changing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And we aren't just talking about indie games here. Triple-AAA games from big studios can now be played on Mac, and many newer games are now being created with Mac playability in mind from the start.</p><p>It's a great time to be alive as a Mac gamer, especially if you're a fan of <a href=#>RPGs</a>. Want to get started? Here are some of the best role-playing games for Mac.</p><h2 id=stardew-valley>1. Stardew Valley</h2><p>Stardew Valley provides a peaceful alternative to the nonstop combat of most RPG games. With its cozy retro-style graphics, you're in for a charming new take on farming. If you've dismissed it for the farming aspects, don't judge it by that alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For classic RPG fans, Stardew Valley offers many of the typical experiences. If you want to crawl dungeons, complete quests, upgrade your gear, and focus your talents to power-up your character then those elements are all there. The hit-and-run style of combat also keeps you on your toes while descending the mines.</p><p>Beyond that, you'll enjoy roleplaying a small-town life with a diverse cast of neighbors. Plus, there's an endless number of collectibles and secrets to discover. The addition of multiplayer also provides an easy way for friends to help each other's farms succeed.</p><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Stardew Valley on <a href=#>GOG</a> |&nbsp;<a href=#>Steam</a></p><h2 id=bastion>2. Bastion</h2><p>Bastion is, in a word, beautiful. Not only is it visually striking and immediately recognizable as unique, but everything is elevated to a completely different level by the soundtrack.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's nothing revolutionary about the story or the gameplay, but you'll find yourself forgetting that as the narrator's smooth voice responds to your progress. Like reading a novel or watching a movie, Bastion is more about the emotional journey than it is about mechanical depth.</p><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Bastion on <a href=#>GOG</a> | <a href=#>Steam</a></p><h2 id=borderlands-2>3. Borderlands 2</h2><p>Borderlands 2 is an award-winning title for anyone looking for a blend of FPS and RPG. In single-player, you go around completing missions and collecting loot from the enemies you kill. With the main storyline and dozens of sidequests, there's constant action that will lead to you owning better equipment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Borderlands 2's multiplayer also allows you to play with your friends as much or as little as you want. The drop-in and drop-out style makes multiplayer an incredibly relaxed experience. Plus, you can enjoy an increased challenge when teaming up with friends.</p><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Borderlands 2 on <a href=#>Steam</a> | <a href=#>Mac App Store</a></p><h2 id=into-the-breach>4. Into the Breach</h2><p>Into the Breach offers a strategic alternative to the other titles on this list. Using turn-based combat, you'll progressively expand your tactics to combat the alien force. There are patterns to each enemy formation and terrain, so you quickly learn without it ever seeming unfair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As such, this game provides a great option for anyone looking for a challenge without the difficulty curve being too high. With randomly generated scenarios, it also offers excellent replayability. In addition, there are different pilots to choose and different ways to customize your mech squad. Which means you'll always be thinking of new ways to approach the threat.</p><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Into the Breach on <a href=#>GOG</a> | <a href=#>Steam</a></p><h2 id=torchlight-ii>5. Torchlight II</h2><p>Torchlight II is the perfect game to play when you want something like Diablo III but not as intense. It's a hack-and-slash adventure that's surprisingly polished and addictive. In comparison to its predecessor, it's also improved its character progression as well.</p><p>Plus, the added bonus of mod support offers some additional customization for those wanting to experience more of the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Torchlight II on <a href=#>GOG</a> | <a href=#>Steam</a></p><h2 id=undertale>6. Undertale</h2><p>Undertale impresses from its concept alone. You can get through the game without defeating a single monster, or you can play it like any other RPG. If you have ever felt guilty about all those defeated enemies, you can finally experience battles from a pacifist's approach.</p><p>You'll never be able to complain that you're just button mashing either. Beyond the novelty of the combat decisions, Undertale offers an engrossing story with lovable characters you want to root for. Every character and monster has weight, so you'll remember them long after you finish the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The one-man soundtrack for the game alone demands a playthrough. You've likely heard a few of them even if you've never played the game, and Undertale boasts one of <a href=#>the best video game soundtracks for studying or relaxing</a>.</p><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Undertale on <a href=#>GOG</a> | <a href=#>Steam</a></p><h2 id=darkest-dungeon>7. Darkest Dungeon</h2><p>Darkest Dungeon is simply incredible. The art style sucks you right in, then the gameplay hooks you and keeps you engaged for hours and hours. It's the kind of game that you intend to play for only 10 minutes, only to realize that the whole day has gone by and you're now starving.</p><p>As far as squad-based dungeon crawlers go, Darkest Dungeon is one of the best because of how punishing it is. The mechanics are brilliant, showing you the effects and consequences of stress on an adventuring party and the risk/reward of pushing your luck as far as it can go before everything collapses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Darkest Dungeon on <a href=#>GOG</a> | <a href=#>Steam</a></p><h2 id=mount-and-blade-warband>8. Mount and Blade: Warband</h2><p>Mount and Blade isn't just an open-world game. It's a sandbox game that doesn't even have a main storyline. You choose what you want to do in the game: explore, fight, quest, and more. The way you interact with others in the game has a real impact on the world at large.</p><p>The biggest reason to get Warband over the original Mount and Blade is the addition of multiplayer. There are seven different game modes that you can play with up to 64 players and bots. Modes include deathmatch, team deathmatch, conquest, capture the flag, siege, fight and destroy, and straight-up battle.</p><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Mount and Blade: Warband on <a href=#>GOG</a> | <a href=#>Steam</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wildermyth>9. Wildermyth</h2><p>Do you want to play a tabletop RPG from home? Wildermyth lets you explore a long-narrative campaign while engaging in tactical combat. Plus, the lovely papercraft art further drives home the tabletop feel.</p><p>Besides offering a distinct look, your character choices matter. Your characters can take lasting wounds from battle, age, fall in love, and leave a legacy. You have a true hand in their fates and the ongoing narrative.</p><p>On top of the character and narrative choices, you'll find a variety of unique game systems. Wildermyth deserves a lot of praise for its unique use of magic that involves the battle environment.</p><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Wildermyth on <a href=#>Steam</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=legend-of-grimrock-ii>10. Legend of Grimrock II</h2><p>Legend of Grimrock was a spiritual successor to the cult classic dungeon crawler Dungeon Master, and many consider it to be the title that revived the classic dungeon crawler genre by faithfully combining old-school gameplay with modern graphics.</p><p>Legend of Grimrock II expands on its predecessor with a bigger world, better character development, a higher level of challenge, and improved freedom of progression. If you love crawling through dungeons, don't skip this one.</p><p><strong>Buy:</strong> Legend of Grimrock II on <a href=#>GOG</a> | <a href=#>Steam</a></p><h2 id=enjoy-the-best-rpg-games-for-mac>Enjoy the Best RPG Games for Mac</h2><p>When compiling the best RPG games for Mac, we found both established studio and indie games alike.
