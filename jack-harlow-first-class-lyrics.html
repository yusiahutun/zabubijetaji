My first tour, I went to Madison, Wisconsin, did a bar with eight people in it, like I felt those feelings of not being the guy at all. Yeah, bravado on record, but then I’m going around and finding out I’m not the guy,” he said. Harlow also told Lowe about how he believes he manifested his success by believing in himself.&nbsp;“I’m slowly in the process of if you regard yourself that way first, I’ve seen the world start to regard me how I regarded myself first in so many different way,” he said. “I thought I was that, they didn’t think so. By the time I’m on to thinking I was the step above that, they’re like, oh, I see him is what he’s … They just start to believe you. Now we’re in the era, I believe him. I believe him.”</p><p>If you’ve listen to <a href=# rel=noopener>Jack Harlow’s “First Class” lyrics</a>, you may have noticed that much of the chorus samples <a href=# rel=noopener>Fergie</a>‘s “Glamorous.” But what does the Dutchess herself think?

The song is his second number one on the Billboard Hot 100 after Lil Nas X’s “Industry Baby,” which Harlow is featured on. “First Class” was released as a single in April 2022 and went viral on TikTok. The song samples Fergie’s 2006 song, “Glamorous,” from her album, The Dutchess, in its chorus.</p><p>“<span class=s2>I been a (<span class=s1><i>G</i>), throw up the (<i>L</i>), sex in the (<i>A.M.</i>), uh-huh / </span></span><span class=s1>(<i>O-R-O-U-S, yeah</i>) / </span><span class=s2>And I can put you in (<span class=s1><i>First class, up in the sky</i>) / </span></span><span class=s1>I can put you in (<i>First class, up in the shit, up-up in the shit</i>) / </span><span class=s2>I been a (<span class=s1><i>G</i>), throw up the (<i>L</i>), sex in the (<i>A.M.</i>), uh-huh / </span></span><span class=s1>(<i>O-R-O-U-S, yeah</i>) / </span><span class=s2>And I can put you in (<span class=s1><i>First class, up in the sky</i>), mm, mm / </span></span><span class=s1>I can put you in (<i>First class, up in the shit, up-up in the shit</i>),” the lyrics in the chorus read.</span></p><p><span>In an interview with “The Breakfast Club” in May 2022, Harlow explained that sampling Fergie’s “Glamorous” on “First Class” was his idea, but his team wasn’t into the idea at first. “When I was in the studio making it, and once the first verse and the chorus were done, I was like, ‘This is a hit.’ I was charged up. I was telling everyone around me, ‘Yo, this is a hit.’ And everyone was like, ‘Hmm, I don’t know if it’s a hit, bro.’ And I was like, ‘Damn, am I tripping? Like is it not a hit?’ … ‘I feel so strong about this,’” he said. He continued, </span>“I’m proud of myself on that one, and I’ve been wanting that type of record. I idolized Fergie as a kid, so this is so full-circle for me, it’s crazy.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Extra</a> in April 2022, Harlow revealed that he hadn’t talked to Fergie directly since the release of “First Class” but “heard through the grapevine” that she liked the song. <span>“I heard through the grapevine that she loved it,” he said. “But I love Fergie. I’ve loved Fergie for years. To me, it wasn’t just like an opportunist type of energy; to me, I’ve been waiting to do that.” He continued, “</span>People don’t know when I was in 5th grade, I tried to perform ‘Fergalicious’ at the talent show, and they said ‘no’ because it was too explicit. So I didn’t get to do it. But I’ve loved Fergie for that long. And I think now, everything just connected. I was so grateful she cleared it.”</p><p>So what are Jack Harlow’s “First Class Lyrics” lyrics?
