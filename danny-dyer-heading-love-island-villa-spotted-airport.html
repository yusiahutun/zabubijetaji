She added that the soap star might be jealous of Dani's beau, Jack, joking: "I think he's a might jealous. Oh yes, very jealous." Jo, who shares three children with Danny, also revealed her opinion on Dani's salesman boyfriend, saying: "I like Jack. I really like the fact he can sell a pen, pens are really big in my house. Love the fact he can make a bed. I'm never going to get a call from Dani saying there's a big pile of washing or that he hasn't made the bed.

It's a game show. 50 grand at stake and Dani's going to win it... I cannot moan as a father. She hasn't put a foot wrong... We're watching it unfold and it isn't that bad Piers."</p><p id=e-evESCnX40h data-wc=1><strong>EXCLUSIVE: <a class=hm-link href=#>See Love Island's Megan before her glam makeover</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
