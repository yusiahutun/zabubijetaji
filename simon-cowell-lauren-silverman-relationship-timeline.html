Simon <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>has since spoken up</a></strong> about how he was "not proud" of the affair which started the couple's relationship.</p><p id=ek-vPu23S26k data-wc=47>"It is not something I am proud of or wanted to happen in terms of hurting anyone," he told the in 2014.

Since then the pair have enjoyed many <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>red carpet outings</a></strong> together.</p><h2><strong>How many children does Simon Cowell have?</strong></h2><p id=evxOB84KHyHE data-wc=49>Simon has two children. He is the stepfather of Lauren's son from her previous marriage, Adam, and the father of another son called Eric, who he shares with Lauren. Eric was born on Valentine's Day 2014, after the couple had been dating for around a year and a half.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/0dd6ebf66c4c-gettyimages-1021479310.jpg><p id=ezk29qxoRfRL data-wc=38>While being interviewed by <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>the BBC</a></strong> in August 2013, the TV star revealed he hadn't considered having children in the past, saying: "It's something I hadn't thought of before." However, his mind evidently changed after he met Lauren.</p><p id=eZyAAnLpgkU5 data-wc=17>"I'm proud to be a dad," he revealed, explaining: "Now I know I feel good about it."</p><p id=eIbedmTxN0Kt data-wc=59>During an appearance on <a class=hm-link href=#>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a> in 2021, Simon revealed more about his shift in opinion, saying: "After I lost my parents, I genuinely felt, Kelly, I would never feel that kind of love for anyone ever again. I thought that was it… until I saw the scan of [Eric] for the first time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/24b6885d5c57-gettyimages-1423517700.jpg><p id=eZt4NTNWsnN8 data-wc=40>"From that moment I saw the scan, I was like 'That is it, I'm besotted,'" he continued.

He was a big part of it," he told <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Tonight</a></strong>.</p><p id=encyiqjHbbpA data-wc=55>He&nbsp;later explained how the pandemic had also contributed to his changed stance on marriage. "I think after everything&nbsp;all of us&nbsp;had gone through over the past two&nbsp;years,&nbsp;it has changed our lives in so many ways," he said. "Family is everything and that is what I kind of took away from it."</p><p id=ejteTzkKRclQ data-wc=49>Although there were rumors to suggest the couple were aiming to <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>we</a><a class=hm-link href=#>d in mid-2022</a></strong>, it appears the pair are still preparing for their special day one year on from their proposal.
