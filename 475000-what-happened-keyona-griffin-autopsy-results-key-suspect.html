Sadly, the call operator missed some critical information, especially when she said her aunt had already been killed.</p><p class=align-left>The three Grand Rapids <a href=#>Police officers</a> showed up at the murder scene (553 Sheldon Avenue SE near Buckley Street) precisely seven minutes and 41 seconds after Keyona's 911 conversation ended.</p><p class=align-left>When they arrived, they saw nothing at the house that gave them legal cause to break in.
