She re-recorded and released previous albums after losing ownership of her masters. It was quite a big step in the music industry that has set a precedent for many artists across various genres. Each of the records has stormed the top of the charts and now fans are just eagerly waiting for Swift to release another Taylor’s Version – and they’ve gathered ‘evidence’ when we’ll see Reputation.</strong></p><p>The singer has treated fans to an abundance of <a href=#>music</a> over the past few years. To regain control of the rights to her older music – without having to pay an absurd fee for the original master recordings – she is re-recording her first six albums. Her back catalog was sold to a private equity firm, so heading back to the studio means <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> owns the rights to every single one of them. But to make each re-release extra special, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> also adds Vault Tracks – unheard songs that were left on the cutting room floor, so to speak. One example being, the full 10-minute version of All Too Well, which was trimmed down to a more radio-friendly four minutes on the original release. Aside from this, she’s also been working on new music. She dropped two albums during the pandemic, when we were all sitting on Zoom calls in our pajamas, and in 2022 she released Midnights, her 10th record.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-reputation-is-next-on-the-list-for-taylor-swift-s-version>Reputation is next on the list for Taylor Swift’s Version</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1956522725-1024x783.jpg><p>Reputation saw Taylor Swift’s sound transform, and fans were teased the T Version will include <a href=#>Vault Tracks that will be ‘fire’</a>. It’s caused them to go into a frenzy, so we’re sure the tracks will storm the charts once again, much like all her previous re-releases.</p><p>One compelling reason fans are convinced it’s the next on the list, and more importantly soon, is because Swift was officially allowed to re-record Reputation as Taylor’s Version back in November 2022. It’s believed to be down to legal reasons, most likely from contract obligations that stopped her before. If that’s the case, there’s only two albums left on the list, and Reputation had higher streams than her debut record, so it seems the best fit for Swift to do as a Taylor’s Version.</p><p>She also has spoken about re-recording the songs for it, via Time, so it’s pretty much in the bag. She said Reputation represents “a goth-punk moment of female rage at being gaslit by and entire social structure”. As Tay Tay has already spoke about revisiting the album, then she probably has done a lot of the recording. That means surely there isn’t much more to do than the editing and getting it ready to release. What we don’t know, is when it’s coming.</p><p>So what about when it’s going to drop?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-convinced-something-will-be-announced-within-days>Fans convinced something will be announced within days</h2><p>As listeners are still on the edge of their seats, it’s small teasers that have caused a ruckus with Swifties.</p><p>The first being her friends, family and beau <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> changing all their Instagram profiles to black and white. We see the lakes of Blake Lively, <a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a> and Keleigh Teller take part. Bit of a strange coincidence, perhaps?</p><p>One follower posted on <a href=#>Twitter</a> a strange, but not completely impossible, theory. They believe it’ll release on February 5th, as the numbers 2 and 5 could look like snakes – part of the imagery of the album.</p><p>They then explained, if we add up the numbers of the release date individually, it totals 15. If she re-released Reputation, it would be technically her 15th album (10 studio, 5 re-records). 2 + 5 + 2 … and so on.</p><p>Also, the Grammys, one of the prestigious music <a href=#>award shows</a> of the year, are taking place on February 4th. Now, Tay Tay is no stranger to announcing album releases when receiving an award. In 2022, at the <a href=#>MTV Video Music Awards</a>, she told the world Midnights was coming out. She then unveiled track list via TikTok videos every single day leading up to it.</p><p>Could this year’s Grammys be the next one?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-february-seems-to-be-a-common-theme-in-the-theories>February seems to be a common theme in the ‘theories’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit"></figure><p>We know our girl loves Harry Potter and Easter Eggs. She admitted herself she leaves Horcuxes for her fans when it comes to new music, re-releases and information leaking. She told Time: “I’m collecting infinity stones.</p><p>“Gandalf’s voice is in my head every time I put out a new one. For me, it’s a movie now.”</p><p>Another theory backs up February being the month of Reputation as February 1 is National Serpent Day – again linked to the record.</p><p>Next, Taylor Nation, her official fan club who do wonders for her PR and marketing, put out an Easter Egg of their own. They put up a story on <a href=#>Instagram</a> at the end of last year of a Taylor playlist on Spotify. But they input the tag line “we could leave the Christmas lights up til… February?” which caught attention. The original lyrics say January, but eagle-eyed Swift fans are convinced the change to February is linked to Reputation Taylor’s Version.</p><p>Surely this is all connected for a reason?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-taylor-swift-herself-saying-about-her-version-of-reputation>What is Taylor Swift herself saying about her version of Reputation?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1924063395-1-682x1024.jpg><p>We’ve fallen down a rabbit hole with fan theories, but what is the woman saying herself? Not much, but she doesn’t need to speak to say anything – true Swifties know this through and through.</p><p>Lately, Swift has been seen wearing black and dark clothing, referencing Reputation. This week, she ventured out with new NFL bestie Brittany Mahomes, and the whole girl squad was dressed in black. We get it.</p><p>Let’s not forget, two weeks ago, while eating Pizza with Blake Lively in New York, she wore a green dress – snakeskin hello? – and Jimmy Choo x Jean Paul Gaultier boots. The thigh-high boots were covered in serpents.</p><p>Then at the Golden Globes she wore a gorgeous green skintight gown which was screaming Horcrux.</p><p>But she hasn’t exactly kept quiet either. She spoke to Time Magazine after being called Person of the Year in 2023. This is when she told fans the vault tracks will be ‘fire’ – so she’s already done them?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-which-albums-is-taylor-swift-re-recording>Which albums is Taylor Swift re-recording?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1917155501-751x1024.jpg><p>The star has already released four of her previous albums. Fearless (2008), Speak Now (2010), Red (2012), and 1989 (2014). Red and Fearless were dropped again in 2021, while the other two in 2023. The only two that remain currently are Taylor Swift – her self-titled debut album – as well as Reputation, which originally came out in 2017.</p><p>For 1989 Taylor’s Version, she added an extra five songs from The Vault to fan’s delight.</p><p>The icon chose to go down this route, partly inspired by Kelly Clarkson and her dad. They both told her to just ‘do it’ and re-record them, even if she was skeptical. Her former record label, Big Machine Records, sold her masters to Ithaca Holdings, owned by Scooter Braun. It’s said the deal was worth around $300 million.</p><p>Another reason to go back to the microphone was so her music can be used in <a href=#>movies</a> and adverts. As it stands, when she receives requests for her music to feature in a movie trailer or ad, she has to turn them down.</p><p>She told Billboard: “And the reason I’m rerecording my music next year is because I do want my music to live on. I do want it to be in movies, I do want it to be in commercials. But I only want that if I own it.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eCcIOMqaCem5WoerCyjJymp66Zo7CqusZmnK%2BhlJq7pLGMrK6inqSoerOxz66rmqyZpLtuwMCyo6iqo2LDpr7SoqanZZmoeqS7zKKloGWfqsFuv86opWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./article-369eaa6c-5160-11ed-88dd-833f40364c47-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Calvin Burton | Death Notices</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rajiv-surendra.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Rajiv Surendra dating?
