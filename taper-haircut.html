While tapered haircuts are a great option for men and women of all ages, we asked Powell and Nunzio Saviano, stylist and owner of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nunzio Saviano Salon,</a> what you need to know before getting a tapered haircut. Read on to find out what they had to say.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-tapered-haircuts-suitable-for-any-hair-texture></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are Tapered Haircuts Suitable For Any Hair Texture?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes. Whether your hair is curly, straight or natural, a tapered cut can work for you. However, Saviano adds that it's very important to know that regardless of your hair texture, if your hair is tapered at the hairline it will become very short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Your hair will almost be to the skin," he says. "Sometimes the stylist will leave it natural looking or finish with a trimmer for more definitive lines. Regardless of how it's done, the hair is very short."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-does-a-tapered-haircut-differ-from-a-fade></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Does a Tapered Haircut Differ From a Fade?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A tapered haircut typically starts out longer at the top of the head and gets shorter as you go down to the natural hairline on the nape and sides of the head," says Powell. "A fade is a taper that gradually takes the hair down to the skin, so that it looks like the hairline on the sides and back of your head 'fades' away before it reaches the natural hairline. A fade is a very short version of a taper."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The "Bixie" Is a New Take on the Most Controversial Haircut of the '90s</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-should-you-avoid-getting-a-tapered-haircut></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When Should You Avoid Getting a Tapered Haircut?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you don't like clippers or trips to the barber, then a tapered haircut may not work for you, says Powell. 'Cause to keep your tapered haircut looking on point, you'll have to visit a barber every few weeks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What makes a tapered cut sharp-looking is the length," says Saviano. "The longer your hair gets, the less of a fade you'll have. It's best to have a barber touch up your tapered cut every three to four weeks to keep it looking fresh."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-some-different-types-of-tapered-haircuts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Some Different Types of Tapered Haircuts?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>@nunziosavianosalon</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are different variations of the tapered haircut, so it's best to consult a stylist and ask what length and style will look best on you. "A graduated bob can be tapered in the back, at the nape of the head that's shaped into the hairline without making sharp definite clean lines," says Saviano. "There's also fro-hawks, asymmetrical tapered cuts — where the curls on top are cut at an angle, and a layered pixie tapered cut, which is good for people who have fine hair and desire more volume," says Powell.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-style-a-tapered-cut></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Style a Tapered Cut?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The great thing about tapered haircuts is that you won't need to stand in the mirror for hours trying to perfect the style, but it will need a little TLC.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Whether your tapered hair section is on the side, back or all around your head, it won't require styling, but the rest of the longer hair will require styling, depending on the final desired look or the hair texture," says Siviano.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, you will need to have a set wash day routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For all hair textures I recommend regularly getting trims and using a clarifying shampoo to make sure your scalp is clean and doesn't get weighed down with oil or buildup," adds Powell.
