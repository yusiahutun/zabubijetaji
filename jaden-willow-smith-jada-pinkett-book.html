The two separated in 2016 and they simply grew out of the relationship yet. As to why they haven’t filed for divorce, Pinkett Smith told Hoda Kotb in a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>preview</a>&nbsp;of an hour long primetime interview that the two are “just not being ready yet … Still trying to figure out between the two of us how to be in partnership … In regards to, how do we present that to people? We hadn’t figured that out.”</p><p>Kotb asked about what exactly made the marriage fracture, “Why it fractured…that — that’s a lot of things,” Pinkett Smith revealed. “By the time we got to 2016, we were just exhausted with trying. I think we were both kind of just still stuck in our fantasy of what we thought the other person should be.”</p><p>She also talked about the promise she made to Smith. “I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce. We will work through … whatever,” Pinkett Smith says. “I just haven’t been able to break that promise.”</p><p>She echoed the same sentiment in an exclusive interview with<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;People</a>. “We’re still figuring it out. We’ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together. We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.”</p><p>In an email to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The New York Times</a>, Will Smith shared that Jada Pinkett Smith’s memoir served as a wake up call for him.</p><p>“When you’ve been with someone for more than half of your life,” he wrote, “a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties.”&nbsp;</p><p>Will also shared his thoughts on Jada’s memoir in a letter penned for Jay Shetty’s podcast, “On Purpose,” where Jada recently appeared to discuss her forthcoming book. A clip from her episode, which&nbsp;drops in full on Oct. 16, was shared by the Associated Press on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>YouTube</a>.</p><p>During Jada Pinkett Smith’s appearance, Jay Shetty offered to read her estranged husband’s letter out loud for her.</p><p>“I applaud and honor you. If I had read this book 30 years ago, I definitely would’ve hugged you more,” read the letter.</p><p>“I’ll start now. Welcome to the Authors Club,” Shetty said, continuing to read the letter. “I love you endlessly. Now go get some Merlot and take a rest.”</p><p>Jada initially laughed at Will’s comments, joking, “He know I can’t have no Merlot.” But the actress went on to express her appreciation for Will’s note. “That’s beautiful,” she said. “That’s why I can’t divorce that joker.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/worthy-jada-pinkett-smith.jpg><p>Jada Pinkett Smith was living what many would view as a fairy-tale of&nbsp;Hollywood success.
