The Japanese philosophy centres on a minimalist aesthetic but embraces rustic materials, the celebration of imperfection and the inclusion of unique objects that tell a story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/24/bb9e3766-1f54-4619-b315-245538c7f7d2_6360e280.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This South Lantau home offers a master class in replicating the understated but nevertheless elegant style. Not only is there an abundance of natural wood but the linear detailing on the sofa’s skirting, the fluted oak panels around the kitchen island and reeded wood pieces in the family room also continue the “line” theme and tie the rooms together.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additionally, traditional glazed Zellige tiles, handmade by Moroccan craftsmen, which feature on the kitchen splashback, enhance the interior’s artisanal angle and echo the asymmetric strokes of the living room painting, which was commissioned from Spanish artist Bea Aiguabella.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Liipfert Lam also reached out to local artisans and artists, including architect-turned-woodworker Filip Winiewicz, from Hardwood HK, ceramicist Mariane Chan, of Mceramics, and Scandinavian/European furniture specialists Studio Wool.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She collaborated with them on designs for everyday pieces that would function on a practical level as well as add to the design language.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I often propose bespoke items that fit with the smaller aspects of life because it turns the ordinary into something meaningful,” she says. “And it was great to work with Hong Kong craftspeople.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/24/01d95fba-47b6-47c1-93b8-0d8c39133bcb_4e8e8093.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The couple had requested a relaxed, Balinese look and this is particularly evident in the main bedroom. Using a textured marble-effect paint in soft clay hues, Liipfert Lam created a cosy, cocoon-like environment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To this she added a custom-made American walnut bed, which rests on four solid wooden spheres, and rattan wardrobes, adorned with arched walnut mouldings and textured wallcoverings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Liipfert Lam loved working on this project, it wasn’t all plain sailing. Challenges included South Lantau being a no-delivery zone for 90 per cent of the pieces ordered (everything had to be coordinated for pickup from Tung Chung and then transported individually in batches to the site) as well as the worst black rainstorm in years and a typhoon 10 in the final weeks of the project.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What renovation project doesn’t have problems?” says the designer. “We eventually overcame all of these issues and after a year from the initial concept meeting, the family moved in last fall. I am so proud to see it all come together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/01/24/82f39c0f-304f-47bc-9d19-071e70737a91_4e8e8093.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Living room</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A commissioned artwork by Bea Aiguabella (antonaiguabella.com) takes pride of place in the living room, positioned above a custom-made LÜP sofa frame with fluted moulding, designed by Jocelyn Liipfert Lam, of LIIPSTIIK (liipstiik.com), in collaboration with Filip Winiewicz, of Hardwood HK (hardwoodhk.com).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The teak/natural cane Kangaroo chairs and Tangāli side table (used as a coffee table) were by Phantom Hands and the TMM light was by Santa & Cole, all bought from Studio Wool (woolstudio.co).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The daybed OW150 by Carl Hansen & Son was supplied by Out of Stock (outofstock.com.hk) and the Moroccan Berber Tulu rug came from 1stDibs (1stdibs.com).
