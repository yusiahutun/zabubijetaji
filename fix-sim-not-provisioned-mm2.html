The "SIM not provisioned MM2" error is easy enough to fix, but what does it mean?</p><p>In this article, we explain how to fix this SIM card error and ensure you can avoid it happening again in the future.</p><h2 id=what-does-quot-sim-not-provisioned-quot-mean>What Does "SIM Not Provisioned" Mean?</h2><p>SIM cards contain certain information that helps with the identification of your cell phone account.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The SIM enables the phone to be identified as yours on the mobile network (<a href=#>thanks to the IMEI number</a>). This enables you to make calls and connect to the mobile internet.</p><p>To understand why your phone may be displaying a "SIM not provisioned" error message, it helps to know what the word "provisioned" means. Provision can be defined as the act of providing or supplying something. In the case of your SIM card, your sim is not provisioned if it is no longer able to share information between your cellphone and your provider.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/muo-hardware-review-unihertz-ticktock-sim-slot.JPG><p>The "SIM not provisioned" error should only affect users who need to register a new SIM card. If it occurs at any other time, it can signify a problem with the SIM card, which will need replacing.</p><p>When the "SIM card not provisioned MM2" error appears, you can trace it back to one of the following:</p><ul><li>You bought a new phone with a new SIM card.</li><li>You're transferring contacts to a new SIM card.</li><li>Your mobile network provider's server is unavailable (if you're using an iPhone, the Apple server also needs to be online).</li><li>There's a problem with the placement of the SIM card.</li></ul><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Other SIM error messages might occur, depending on your situation. For instance, if the SIM card is locked to a particular phone, when you insert it into a new device you may see the "SIM not valid" message. <a href=#>Unlocking the SIM</a> will let you use it in any compatible phone.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-quot-sim-not-provisioned-for-voice-quot-error>What Is the "SIM Not Provisioned for Voice" Error?</h2><p>An error that is growing in frequency is "SIM not provisioned for voice." It commonly occurs on devices connected to the Google Fi network (a combination of mobile and Wi-Fi networks) and on Google Pixel devices. However, there are also instances where the "SIM not provisioned for voice" error is displaying on other carriers and smartphones.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=what-does-quot-sim-not-provisioned-for-voice-quot-mean>What Does "SIM Not Provisioned for Voice" Mean?</h3><p>In most cases, if your phone is displaying a "SIM not provisioned for voice" error message, then means that you cannot make voice calls. The most common reason for this is that your line has become disconnected from your carrier account.</p><p>The steps below should help to resolve this.</p><h2 id=what-does-quot-sim-2-not-provisioned-quot-error-mean>What Does "SIM 2 Not Provisioned" Error Mean?</h2><p>If the "SIM not provisioned" error specifies a number, then it is almost certainly because you're using a <a href=#>dual-SIM phone</a>. Each slot is numbered, so you might see "SIM 1 not provisioned" and "SIM 2 not provisioned" errors.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This isn't too much to worry about. It simply means that when you follow step four below, you carry out the process twice, for each SIM card.</p><h2 id=7-ways-to-fix-quot-sim-not-provisioned-quot-errors>7 Ways to Fix "SIM Not Provisioned" Errors</h2><p>Try these tricks to re-enable your SIM card and put an end to the "SIM not provisioned" errors on your Android.</p><h3 id=update-carrier-services>1. Update Carrier Services</h3><p>Like most things on your phone, communications between the device and mobile networks is controlled via an app.</p><p>Carrier Services is a Google app that is preinstalled in Android and receives regular updates. If you have found that the “SIM card not provisioned MM#2” error has occurred without you having swapped to a new phone or inserted a new SIM, it could be down to a problem with Carrier Services.</p><p>To fix this:</p><li>Open Google Play</li><li>Tap your account avatar to open the menu</li><li>Tap <strong>Manage apps and device</strong></li><li>Under Updates available tap <strong>See details</strong></li><li>Look for Carrier Services</li><li>Tap <strong>Update</strong></li><p>If Carrier Services is not available in this list, the cause of the SIM not provisioned error is something else.</p><h3 id=enable-and-disable-airplane-mode>2. Enable and Disable Airplane Mode</h3><p>Perhaps the simplest of all potential “SIM not provisioned MM2” errors is to disable all connectivity on the phone or tablet.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This is easily done thanks to Airplane Mode, a state that any mobile device can be switched into with a single tap. Enabling Airplane Mode disables connections to mobile internet and basic cellular networks; by subsequently disabling Airplane Mode, the aim is to re-establish a fresh connection to overcome the SIM not provisioned error.</p><p>To put Android into Airplane Mode:</p><li>Swipe down from the top of the screen with two fingers</li><li>In the <strong>Quick Settings</strong> screen, tap <strong>Airplane Mode</strong></li><li>Wait for the change (just a few seconds)</li><li>When you’re ready to undo, simply repeat steps 1-2 2 Images <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/muo-android-sim-not-provisioned-airplane-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/muo-android-sim-not-provisioned-airplane-1.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span></li><p>At that point, a fresh connection should be made with the mobile network. If the SIM is working properly, the “SIM not provisioned MM2” error should no longer appear.</p><h3 id=restart-your-phone>3. Restart Your Phone</h3><p>It may seem unlikely, but simply turning off your phone can overcome the SIM not provisioned fault.</p><p>Take the usual steps to restart the phone and wait. A few moments later you'll see that the error message no longer appears, and your SIM card is activated.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=correctly-insert-the-sim-card>4. Correctly Insert the SIM Card</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/muo-android-sim-not-provisioned-card.jpg><p>If the issue isn't with the SIM card's activation or the network, then it might simply be an ill-fitting SIM. This might be due to problems with the shape of the SIM itself or a badly designed SIM card slot (or caddy).</p><p>To check if the SIM is correctly seated, switch off your phone, then find the SIM card:</p><ul><li>If you have an older, or cheaper phone, find the SIM card by opening the back panel. You may need to remove the battery to access the SIM card slot.</li><li>With flagship phones or those without removable batteries, the SIM card slot is usually at the side of the handset. This is typically a caddy upon which the SIM card sits---you'll need a small SIM eject tool to open it. Look for a small hole along the side of your phone and push the tool in to eject the SIM.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to remove the SIM card and not the microSD storage card.</p><p>Removing the SIM card can be tricky. You may need to use tweezers, or jimmy it out from underneath if a removable battery is involved. With the SIM card removed, give it a blow, and perhaps a quick dust with a lint-free cloth.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Replace the cleaned SIM card, taking care to position it as instructed. There is usually a sticker next to the SIM card slot, or an engraving illustrating the SIM's correct orientation.</p><p>Replace the SIM card in your phone, and power up again. The "SIM not provisioned" error should no longer appear. If it does, try the SIM in another phone.</p><h3 id=activate-your-sim-card>5. Activate Your SIM Card</h3><p>In most cases, a SIM card will be activated automatically within 24 hours of being inserted in a new phone. If this doesn't happen, three options are usually available to enable activation:</p><li>Call an automated number</li><li>Send an SMS</li><li>Log onto the activation page on the carrier's website</li><p>All these options are quick and straightforward but depend on whether the carrier supports them. In most cases, your SIM should be activated, and the "SIM not provisioned" error solved.</p><h3 id=contact-your-carrier-or-network-provider>6. Contact Your Carrier or Network Provider</h3><p>If the SIM doesn't activate, it's time to make a call (from another device!) to your carrier or network. Explain to them the error message and the steps you've taken so far.</p><p>As noted above, there may be an issue with the activation server, which would prevent your SIM card from activating. This would cause the "SIM not provisioned" error message.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Your carrier will typically keep you on the line while they investigate the issue. If it is a problem with the activation server, there may be some delay in getting the SIM activated. On the plus side, you'll have a reason for the error and a possible date for resolution.</p><h3 id=get-a-new-sim-card>7. Get a New SIM Card</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/muo-android-sim-not-provisioned-new.jpg><p>Still no joy? It's time to request a new SIM card, maybe even an eSIM, if your phone supports it.</p><p>You could call your network for this, but you'll probably find it's quicker to head to a local phone shop. Even better, a branch of your network or a franchise outlet.</p><p>They'll be able to run diagnostics on the SIM card and hopefully, resolve the "SIM not provisioned MM2" error. Don't worry if they repeat some of the steps you've already attempted, as this is part of the diagnostic process.</p><p>If it means you need a new SIM card, this shouldn't be a problem. The store will have the tools in place to manage the swap and associate the new SIM with your account.</p><h2 id=the-quot-sim-not-provisioned-mm-2-quot-error-fixed>The "SIM Not Provisioned MM 2" Error, Fixed!</h2><p>Note that this error will only affect mobile devices that use SIM cards. As long as the SIM is compatible, and fits into the slot, these fixes will work.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>By this point, you should understand why your phone is displaying the "SIM not provisioned MM2" error message. Remember, you have five options to fix this error:</p><li>Update Carrier Services</li><li>Toggle Airplane Mode</li><li>Restart your phone</li><li>Check the SIM is correctly seated</li><li>Correctly activate your SIM</li><li>Contact your carrier for help</li><li>Get a new SIM card</li><p>If none of these things work, then you'll need to contact your carrier/network provider to ask for a replacement card. Once you've got everything sorted, your SIM card should work without a problem.</p><p>Unfortunately, new SIM card errors are appearing all the time, but it doesn't take long for the internet to rally together and start providing at-home solutions. If you find yourself experiencing SIM issues, it's always worth conducting a quick online search to see if someone has found a solution or a workaround.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fm7a5edKipGamn6l6sb7Or6CsoZ%2BjsqV5zKZpaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-chai-cookie-recipe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Make Her Chai Sugar Holiday Cookies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./arsenal-ray-parlour-ripped-pants-30586428.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Arsenal hero Ray Parlour looks 'ripped' at pool - but fans can't take eyes off pants</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
