Before we delve into the size of Blac Chyna and other body statistics, here is some background information about the vixen herself.</p><p>If it was not immediately obvious that ‘Blac Chyna’ is a nickname, then there is a problem. Either way, her real name is Angela Renée White and she was born on 11 May 1988 as the daughter of Shalana Jones-Hunter and Eric Holland. However, her alias was not always Blac Chyna, because back then (2010) she was stripping under the nickname “Cream”. She got her current name from a regular guest in a strip club.</p><p>The man called himself “Black China” because he was a black man with Chinese-looking eyes and she could identify with him. Later that year, Chyna posed for the cover of Dimepiece magazine, and it was the first of many upcoming magazine covers. In the same year, she began appearing in music videos, which earned her the title “Video Fairy”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blac-Chyna-Bio.jpg><p>Today she is a proud entrepreneur and owner of an online boutique ’88fin’ and a beauty bar ‘LASHED’. Unfortunately, she’s more popular with the Kardashians for her dedication than for her achievements, but we bet that’s still good for business.</p><p>Before we delve too deeply into her background story, let’s start with this topic and start with Blac Chyna’s height.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Comparing Scottie Pippen’s Extraordinary Career With His Not So Successful Marriages</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height</strong></h2><p>You don’t need visual aids to see that she is very much on the short side. Blac Chyna doesn’t stand that high at 5 feet 2 inches. It’s funny that she doesn’t look that small in front of the camera, because she has this “big, stocky” build, but her stated height puts her on the list of Hollywood’s shortest celebrities. Blac Chyna’s size 6</p><p>To prove this to you, here is a list of really short celebrities who are shorter than Blac Chyna. There is her sister-in-law, Kim Kardashian West (5 foot 3 inches), Mila Kunis (1.5 foot 3 inches), Britney Spears (5 foot 4 inches), and Sarah Jessica Parker (5 foot 4 inches).</p><p>These are people who are towered over by other celebrities, so we hope this gives a clear picture of how small it is. If it wasn’t, there would be a few people here who are as “big” as she is. Nicki Minaj, Shakira, and Alyssa Milano all share the size of Blac Chyna.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Blac Chyna’s Weight</strong></h2><p>She used to be a stripper, no doubt she keeps the meat where she wants it and loses weight where it counts. Chyna, who has just given birth to Rob Kardashian’s first child, weighed 61 kilograms (135 pounds) before she was pregnant, and she has proven that she is very careful about her weight, especially during pregnancy.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Is Charlie Sheen Gay and What Do We Know About His Worrying Unsuccessful Marriages</a></strong></p><p>At first, she told her fans in snatch chat that she was ready to gain 100 pounds during her pregnancy, but she took that back and decided to keep her pregnancy weight in check by training twice a day in combination with a diet. Here is the subtitle of her Snapchat video after she lost a few pregnancy pounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blac-Chyna-Weight.jpg><p>I started eating and walking cleaner, from 135 to 183 to 176.2 As good as this was for Chyna, expectant mothers should probably check with their gynecologist before going on a diet and exercising, we just had to add this part for safety reasons.</p><p>Now, two weeks after the birth of Baby Dream (yes, seemingly strange baby names that grow in the family later), Blac Chyna has made some serious progress in her postpartum body goals. She has lost 10 kilos (23 pounds) and there is a rumor that her baby’s father, Rob, is a bit jealous. Can you blame him?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blac-Chyna-Wight.jpg><p>She is floating through something that is a constant struggle for him. She looks so good and her belly is already flat, yet we hope that he can turn this envy into inspiration.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Blac Chyna Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>In addition to Blac Chyna’s height and weight, here is a summary of her other body measurements.</p><p><strong>Height</strong>: 5’2</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: pre-baby-61 kg, post baby-76 kg, goal-58 kg</p><p><strong>Bra cup size</strong>: 32 D</p><p><strong>Breast size:</strong> 36 inches</p><p><strong>Waist size</strong>: 27 inches</p><p><strong>Hips size</strong>: 41 inches</p><p><strong>Dress Size</strong>: 10 US, Euro 40, UK 12</p><p><strong>Shoe size</strong>: 8 US, Euro 38-39, UK 6</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kr62twmaaobGelsButMSinqGsXayyqrPHrWSappRir7Cw2Gaknpmjqr%2BmucSnq6xn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./melisamercanozkan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Melisa Mercan zkan, Author at INFLOW Network</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./489648-10-bedroom-house-plans-designs-inspire-you.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 best one bedroom house plans and designs to inspire you</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
