The program has a robust TikTok presence, thanks to its one-of-a-kind model and its viral "Tapping Tuesdays" videos that show how participants use a therapy tool called trauma tapping to aid their recovery.</p><p>Early this month, a group of HARP program participants assembled and<a href=#> filmed a video requesting</a> that Jelly make a stop at the facility while he was in town for his tour date.</p><p>"We need you to stop at Chesterfield County Jail. We here in the HARP program -- this is the HARP community right here, these are my HARP brothers -- we all support you. We love you. We're big fans," one of the participants said. "We need you to come through and give us a hope shot. Speak life, love, strength and hope. Jelly Roll, we need a favor."</p><p>Two more participants then launched into a performance of Jelly's hit single "Need a Favor," accompanied by acoustic guitar. The video quickly went viral -- and not only did Jelly agree to make the stop, but when he arrived, he said that he was as big a fan of the HARP program members as they were of him.</p><p>"I heard y'all needed a favor," Jelly told the group when he arrived at the jail facility, as a chorus of HARP participants chanted his name. "I just wanna say I'm a fan. I was watching on TikTok before y'all started calling for me."</p><p>The singer then led his audience in a group sing-a-long of "Need a Favor," "Son of a Sinner" and "Save Me," stopping in between songs to express his admiration for the inspiring work the HARP program members do.</p><p>"I don't think y'all even realize the impact that y'all are having," he reflected, thinking back on his own experience with incarceration and addiction. "Whenever I was in here, we didn't have a program like this. We didn't have people like us come talk to us."</p><p>Since the earliest days of his country music stardom, Jelly has always made it a priority to support those experiencing incarceration and addiction. In late 2022, he<a href=#> parlayed the proceeds from a sold-out Nashville show </a>to finance the construction of a recording studio at Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center -- the same facility where he was incarcerated as a teen.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>10 Things You Didn't Know About Jelly Roll</h2>The Jelly Roll: Save Me documentary on Hulu tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jelly Roll'</a>s complicated life story and spares no details. He's shockingly honest about addiction, prison, his childhood and his insecurities. Here are 10 key takeaways from the project.<h2 class=photogallery-title>11 Songs that Foreshadowed Jelly Roll's Country Music Career</h2><p>Jelly Roll has taken the country music world by storm over the past year, and he will release his first full-length country album, Whitsitt Chapel, on June 2.
