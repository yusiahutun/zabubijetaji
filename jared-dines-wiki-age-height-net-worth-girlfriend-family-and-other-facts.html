He was also a former drummer with Rest Repose before he finally settled down with the guitar after a line-up change. Dines is also popular as a YouTuber. Already in June 2010, he started his youtube channel th3ycharg3 (now Jared Dines), where he uploads his covers and music-related comedy sketches.</p><p>He also uploads videos that show both original songs and already popular songs, but in the style of metal, as he also reports on metal trivia. Learn more about the YouTube sensation, his age, his family, his girlfriend, and other fascinating facts below.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jared Dines – Age</strong></h2><p>Although the YouTube personality was in Washington on October 6, 1989, there is no further information online about his early life, background, parents, or siblings.</p><p>He launched his YouTube channel back in 2010, and the channel currently has over 1.8 million subscribers and over 4 million viewers. In 2016, he uploaded a video entitled “If Eminem was metal”, which received more than 300,000 hits in just 3 days.</p><p>In February 2016, Jared Dines and Austin Dickey developed a YouTube channel for games, which they called The DickeyDines Show, and which attracted about 50,000 subscribers in less than six months.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Yandy Smith Bio, Net Worth, Kids, Who are The Husband?

In 2011 he uploaded a song from his old band, in which he played both as guitarist and singer. In 2016 he released his own solo EP entitled The Dark.</p><p>In August 2016 Dines announced that he would take a break from video shooting, citing exhaustion and personal problems as reasons for his actions. Asked how long his break would last, he honestly said he was not sure how long it would take him to get back. However, the following month (September 2016) Jared was back and doing what he loved to do most. He returned from his YouTube break with a new title called Demogorgon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Djent 2017 Scam</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Jared Dines was cheated while making a video called Djent 2017. On October 17, 2017, he commissioned a 17-string guitar, which he received from Olson Guitarworks and which he wanted to use for his video at the time.</p><p>Olson Guitarworks had claimed that he was involved in a guitar building and had built numerous guitars for people in the past. He promised to build a 17-string guitar for Dines for this video and charged a little more than 1,000 dollars for it. To start with, Jared paid him $1,200 for the guitar. Later he found out that Nicholas was not in the guitar building at all, but had ordered the guitar through a Chinese website and that it cost him only 400 dollars.</p><p>The photos that Nicholas sent to Jared, showing him “building” the guitar, were in fact fake, as they were just pictures of a dismembered piece of the door.</p><p>Jared Dines made a video in which he exposed the fraud of Olson Guitarworks and apologized to his fans who were waiting for his project Djent 2017. He also expressed his wish to still get the 17-string instrument and asked anyone who would make him a real 17-string guitar to come forward, as he promised to pay for it and be very grateful as it would help him to realize his project.</p><p>After the fraud was discovered, Olson Guitarworks stopped production and deleted all social media accounts.</p><p>Dines finally continued with his video “Djent 2017”, but with a new name – 17 Guitars. A real Australian guitar company called “Ormsby Guitars” approached him and built him a real 18-string guitar for his project “Djent 2018”, which was presented at NAMM 2018.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The YouTube sensation is currently said to be worth $200,000.
