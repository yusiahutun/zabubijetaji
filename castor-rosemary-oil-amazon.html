You might be asking yourself (or Google), “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What is castor oil?</a>” Regenerative medicine expert and WeThrivv Founder, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Dr. Sanjay Batra</a>, previously shared with StyleCaster that <a href=# id=auto-tag_castor-oil data-tag=castor-oil>castor oil</a> comes from the bean of the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis L.) and is rich in triglycerides, fatty acids, and ricinoleic acid. “Castor oil has been used for hundreds, if not thousands of years for skin, hair, and digestive concerns.”</p><p>What does that all have to do with <a href=# id=auto-tag_hair-growth data-tag=hair-growth>hair growth</a>, though? Per Dr. Batra, ricinoleic acid boasts anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that help to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">calm irritation on the scalp</a> and fight fungal overgrowth or bacteria that has the potential to lead to thin, weakened hair. “The most important thing is that castor oil may reduce the production of prostaglandin D2 by a stressed scalp, thereby lowering the amount of this hair growth inhibitor in the hair follicles,” he noted.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Can Castor Oil Really Help Your Hair & Brows Grow? We Asked a Derm For the Truth</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As if castor oil wasn’t enough to help solve your hair woes, Handcraft Blends’ oil also incorporates rosemary oil, which is equally beneficial for your locks. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Dr. Brian Abittan</a>, the Director of Skin and Hair Rejuvenation and Director of Hair Transplantation at Mount Sinai Health System, shared with StyleCaster that there are two studies that show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rosemary oil has the potential to help grow hair</a>. “While certainly more trials and data are needed, rosemary oil does seemingly have potential to help with hair growth,” Dr. Abittan explained.</p><p>Although he says that the mechanism of action causing hair growth is not fully understood yet, it seems that there are multiple ingredients in rosemary oil (rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, camphor, etc.) that could possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-microbial properties. “Together these may help contribute towards hair growth,” he added.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Can Rosemary Oil Actually Make Your Hair Grow?
