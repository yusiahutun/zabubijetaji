Unfortunately, the latter was the general public’s reaction to a video posted by the U.S. Army on November 7, 2023.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ezgif.com-resize-32-1-1024x576.jpg><p>The video, posted on the social media platform X (Formerly Twitter), went viral for all negative reasons shortly after the account posted it. X users took to the quotes and comment section to express their displeasure at the ad, claiming it wasn’t promoting inclusivity.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_%E2%80%9CAnti-Woke%E2%80%9D_Ad></span><strong>The “Anti-Woke” Ad</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The advertisement video that sparked public outrage on X was a 30-second ad that was supposed to promote the army in a good light. The ad depicts a group of soldiers jumping from a Chinook helicopter and parachuting to the ground with smiles.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ezgif.com-resize-30.jpg><p>The video also included the captions “Your greatest victories are never achieved alone” and “Be all you can be.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Publics_Interpretation_of_the_Ad></span><strong>The Public’s Interpretation of the Ad</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On paper, this ad sounds like a regular video to encourage people to join the force. However, that was different from how the public interpreted it. This is because the ad featured predominantly white males, excluding women and people of color.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/198127824_10158943126343558_6883872715488305019_n.jpg><p>As the U.S. army does not consist only of white males, it is easy to understand the need for representation across all boards.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Publics_Outrage></span><strong>The Public’s Outrage</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The video went viral on X, with 13.1 million views and counting. In its comments section and quotes, several users were mocking the ad for its lack of diversity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/69ece9e91fcade43d6d2519d28e0de3a.jpg><p>For example, an X user, Carl Benjamin (@sargon_of_akkad), commented, “Where is the diversity?” along with a confused duck meme. His comment racked up over 176,000 likes and 137 replies agreeing with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Racism_Came_Into_Play></span><strong>Racism Came Into Play&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Surprisingly, another take on the video was that it was racist towards white people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/269523186_285474333607914_2300194299155207945_n.jpg><p>An X account (@BIPOCracism) wrote: “Y’all really think you could treat us (White men) like garbage, enforce diversity quotas, put black women in positions of authority because they’re black women, and expect us to look kindly upon you?</p><p>The U.S. Army is a trash organization that needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conservative_Activists_Opinions></span><strong>Conservative Activists’ Opinions</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to some conservative activists, this video only “reinforced their anger” at the army and its recruitment process. To them, the recent recruitment videos were insufficiently macho and somewhat degrading.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/87262738_2616141655178976_2389520942213627904_n.jpg><p>Many also referenced a previous ad featuring Corporal Emma Malonelord, who talked about how she was “raised by two moms” and had “marched for equality.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Some_People_Had_Unexpected_Reactions></span><strong>Some People Had Unexpected Reactions</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While most people had strong opinions about the video, a select few reacted unexpectedly. They found the video “funny” and an opportunity to share various memes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/653401679699957eae314a415e5fe37b.jpg><p>A user @JoelWBerry commented, “Don’t fall for it, boys,” with a “Star Wars” meme. Another user commented, “just here for the ratio,” with a laughing emoji suggesting he was only there to enjoy the backlash.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Two_People_of_Color_Appeared_in_the_Video></span><strong>Two People of Color Appeared in the Video</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite the uproar caused by the video, there were two non-white soldiers present in the ad. However, deliberately or not, the two people of color were barely visible in the ad, so most people didn’t notice.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_3381.jpg><p>The primary focus in the video was the white males, and one has to watch the video with great intent to notice the other races in it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Negative_Impact_of_the_Video></span><strong>The Negative Impact of the Video</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Without a doubt, the video has already done a lot of damage to society. Its comment section is filled with users complaining about the lack of diversity and opting out of enrolling in the army.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/292370933_5227047110742335_6012350873541351189_n.jpg><p>A user commented, “It’s too late for this marketing campaign to work,” while another wrote, “We’re not fighting your Zionist wars.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Media_Publications_Critisized_the_Video></span><strong>Media Publications Critisized the Video</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The conservative publication “The American Mind” also criticized the video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ezgif.com-gif-maker-5-1024x1024.jpg><p>A representative of the team wrote: “The U.S. Army’s new recruitment ad is so cynical. After 15 years of relentless progressive brainwashing and doing a literal ‘stand down’ to root out “extremists” (i.e., white conservatives), they are now facing an existential recruiting crisis and must return again to seducing the children of said ‘extremists’ into fighting for their country. A country that no longer exists.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Army_Veterans_Also_Had_Something_To_Say></span><strong>Army Veterans Also Had Something To Say</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Army <a href=#>veterans</a> also had their opinions on the matter. Patrick Fox, a military analyst, and U.S. Air Force veteran,&nbsp; suggested the new ad was a result of the army’s widely reported recruitment problems.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/smbAOskb_400x400.jpg><p>He wrote: “This is the recruiting ad equivalent of the U.S. Army hitting the panic button.
