We're talking about packing the right pieces to ensure your vacation wardrobe is on point and easy to carry, especially if you're limited to just a carry-on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, celebrity stylists know a thing or two about packing light and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>packing right</a>, and they've weighed in on the 15 pieces you should always bring along for a flawless traveling wardrobe. Together, their picks create the ultimate vacation capsule wardrobe that allows you to save room in your suitcase while still having many day-to-day options to choose from, no matter how long your stay.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-white-tee></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A White Tee</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When packing for vacation, celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tara Swennen</a> suggests choosing neutral colors for the base of your looks, and a cropped or traditional white tee is a perfect example. "These pieces can be layered as much as possible and go with just about anything:&nbsp;knit pencil skirts, drawstring linen pants, overalls, high-waisted jeans... the list goes on and on," Swennen says. "They are truly the most versatile and lightweight piece to bring!"<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cropped-trousers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cropped Trousers</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to pack bottoms of every shape and color when going on vacation. To keep things simple, Swennen says she likes to stick with three pairs of pants in three basic colors so that she can mix and match them with other neutral or fun pattern tops throughout her stay. "A black, white, and neutral pair will carry to just about anything and can be styled day to night by simply swapping a thing to a heel," she tells us. "I like linens, crepes, or a stretchy fabric that doesn't wrinkle easily and therefore can carry you through a few occasions!"<strong><br></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-bucket-hat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Bucket Hat</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Give your vacation wardrobe a bit of throwback energy starting with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bucket hat</a>—a.k.a., the perfect accessory to block out the sun or to add a bit of panache to your polo shirt and trousers, according to fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Mickey Freeman</a>. "Bucket hats are giving men and women of all ages and walks of life shade while keeping them 'cool,'" he tells InStyle.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-multi-faceted-mini-skirt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Multi-Faceted Mini Skirt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Raise your hand if you've ever worn a mini skirt as a shirt. If not, celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Britt Theodora</a> highly recommends giving this (brilliant) hack a try. "I love two-in-one pieces especially if you are packing a carry-on," Theodora says. "I would style [a skirt] with linen high-waisted pants if I were wearing it as a shirt. If wearing it as a skirt, I would style it with a tie-at-the-tummy button-up shirt!"<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blue-jeans></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Blue Jeans</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Blue jeans and white tees go together like pool bars and bay breezes, but Swennen says that a pair of A+ jeans will get far more than one use on your vacation. "Blue jeans are extremely versatile. Wear them with a loose-fitting blouse, a T-shirt, a duster for an early evening stroll, or with a sexy, tight, knit top for a night on the town," she says.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cutoff-shorts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cutoff Shorts</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While we're on the subject of denim, cutoff shorts are another great example of a piece that can easily be dressed up or down. To do this, Freeman suggests using cool accessories like stacked bracelets or necklaces to add a personal touch. Don't be afraid to rock cut-offs with a pair of wedges or heeled sandals and be sure to have fun with accessories. You are on vacation, after all.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-sundress></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Sundress</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By simply swapping flip-flops for a pair of sexy strappy heels or even some <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>coastal cowgirl</a>-inspired boots, Swennen says that sundresses can be your perfect done-in-one day-to-night piece for a summer vacation. "Pair with a belted blazer, layer with a fun sweater or wrap for the evening, or keep it casual wedges and a fun tote! It's a summer must!"<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-linen-button-down></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Linen Button-Down</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Button-downs make for great tops, but they also make for great layering pieces as well. Theodora says she loves throwing an oversized men's fit "over bathing suits, with jean shorts or unbuttoned."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-statement-accessory></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Statement Accessory</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While you may not need to stuff five pairs of shoes into your suitcase, according to Swennen, a statement accessory is something you might consider adding in. "This could be as simple as a vintage chain Chanel belt or an amazing collar necklace," she tells us. "This will be the one thing that helps elevate your daytime look to a fun evening occasion."<br></p><p>Don't feel comfortable traveling with the family jewels?

"Designed to take you to the beach and beyond, the right coverup is perfect to throw over a swimsuit during the day or can be dressed up for a night out by adding a touch of jewelry or embellished headband."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-wicker-tote></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Wicker Tote</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tyler Minor</a> wicker totes are the It vacation bag because they're so versatile. "These handbags are great to hold your towel and SPF at the beach, or throw a fun scarf around the handle and take it to a fabulous lunch."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-birkenstock-sandals></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Birkenstock Sandals</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Love them or hate them, Birkenstocks are back for good, and Freeman is vouching for them as a vacation must-have. "Now available in new and fun monochromatic colorways, this lightweight and comfortable sandal is a perfect way to balance out a sexy swimsuit with a semi-sheer cover-up to achieve comfortable sexiness," he says.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-favorite-sunglasses></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Favorite Sunglasses</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don't forget your sunnies! While any pair and style will do (whatever makes you feel the best), Freeman tells InStyle he gravitates towards aviators "because they provide maximum coverage, which protects you against those unrelenting sun rays and can also bring a hint of masculinity to the colorful looks people tend to gravitate towards while on vacation."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-a-colorful-kimono></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>A Colorful Kimono</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As far as this writer is concerned, Kimono-like styles aren't talked about nearly enough in the fashion realm, and Minor concurs.
