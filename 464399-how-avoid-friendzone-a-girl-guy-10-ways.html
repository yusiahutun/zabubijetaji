You have always presented yourself as the nice guy, and you do not want to lose that reputation, even when your advances have been turned down. You can still be a darling to your crush or best friend, but do it from a distance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cb6b53cc307bb448.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ nice things to comment on your friend's post to hype them up</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Learning that you have been friend-zoned this entire time and still being present can crush your heart into a million pieces. However, there are signs that you should look out for if you are unsure whether you are friend zoned or they are just unaware of your feelings.</p><h2>How to avoid the friend zone</h2><p class=align-left>Some nightmares come true, and the friend zone is the biggest proof. It's the worst place a guy or girl can be in. It's time you stop falling into their trap! Here are some of the best ways to avoid putting yourself out there for getting friend-zoned by the girls or guys you like.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Follow us on <a href=# title="Instagram - Tuko" rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> - get the most important news directly in your favourite app!</p><h3>1. Initiate physical contact</h3><p class=align-left>You have had this crush on her for the longest time but have never touched her; why? If you feel like you are in the friend zone, initiate a little physical contact.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4060f5ac3c5a23fc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ sweet paragraphs to send to your best friend today 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Does she get goosebumps when you touch her arms? How does she react when you hold her hand? Is she open to public display of affection? Touching her is one way of knowing how she feels about you. If she is irritated, annoyed, or a bit uncomfortable, know that you are deep in the friend zone.</p><h3>2. Break the best friend stereotype</h3><p class=align-left>She always comes to you when she is in trouble. She will dump all her problems on you, and like the nice guy you are, you will solve half of them. This girl you are eyeing will come vent to you, and you will listen to her and talk with her. You are her go-to guy whenever she is having issues, but she does not consider you good enough to date.</p><p class=align-left>She may even treat you as her handyman but keep you at bay when everything is running smooth. Do not be that guy. Do not let her use you if she does not feel the same way about you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><h3>3. Ask for a date</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cb6b53cc307bb448.jpg><p class=align-left>This may be a little difficult, especially if you have been friends for a long time but do it. What's the worst that can happen if you ask for a date? She will probably say no. Ask her for a date over text or in person and see how she reacts.</p><p class=align-left>If she turns it down, you will probably know where you stand in her life. You can again ask her for a non-romantic date and see her response. Is she okay with a friendly date but does not entertain the idea of a<a href=#> romantic date</a>? You are in the friend zone, brother.</p><h3>4. Ditch her sometimes</h3><p class=align-left>You have your home girl whom you love hanging out with. You will go to gigs, and movies, hang out with other friends and even run errands together. You are so used to each other, and you vibe well, but you want more than just a <a href=#>friendship</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Don't be available all the time. One way of avoiding the friend zone is by becoming scarce now and then. The more you avail yourself, the more she sees you as her homeboy, not a man with whom she can pursue romantic relations.</p><h3>5. Avoid the temporary girlfriend title</h3><p class=align-left>Your good friend will always call you a plus one whenever he is invited to an event. You technically play the pretend girlfriend whenever he wants to go somewhere and doesn't have a date.</p><p class=align-left>There is nothing wrong with being a plus one. It, however, sends a different message if this boy you have been crushing on only takes you as a pretend girlfriend but does not want to date you. He likes you and enjoys your company and even introduces you to other people in his life, but that is as far as he can go.</p><h3>6. Hint that other people are interested in you</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>8 ways to win a girl who rejected you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>How to not get stuck in the friend zone? Communication can save you a little trouble. You have some good chemistry with your friend but are not sure if you are in the friend zone or if you two can become an item. Your friend treats you well and comes through for you whenever you need them, but you want more from them.</p><p class=align-left>Why not hint that you can have options if they do not want to be serious with you? You understand the nature of your friendship and know how to hint that other men and women want you if your friend is placing you in the friend zone.</p><h3>7. Flirt a little</h3><p class=align-left>Flirting is harmless as long as you do not cross boundaries. Flirt a little; complement the pants they wore. Tell her how pretty she looked in the sundress. If you are too shy to flirt in person, send a<a href=#> text message </a>during your usual chats.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/37680e627e1181e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to reject a girl politely without hurting her feelings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is one way you can avoid the friend zone through texting. Try flirting to break the sexual tension. How they reply to your flirting will tell you all you need to know about your friend zone situation.</p><h3>8. A little mystery is good</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4060f5ac3c5a23fc.jpg><p class=align-left>Don’t be an open book. Conceal some things in your life. Your friend does not need to know all your favourite foods, most watched shows, daily routine and other personal things. They should not know you as a needy individual, nor should you present yourself as a clown every time.</p><p class=align-left>A little mystery is good, and their curiosity may work to your advantage. Don't air your dirty laundry; it is probably why you are still in the friend zone. Be unpredictable and be occupied from time to time. Share your life with them, but also know when to keep some things to yourself.</p><h3>9. Don’t be the doormat</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5aa879800d66801e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 biggest pet peeves in relationships that will drive you crazy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Why do you keep getting friend zoned? You have allowed yourself to be a doormat. Your female friend has fought with her boyfriend, and who does she think of running to first? You. They later patch things up, and you suddenly do not exist in her <a href=#>world</a> anymore.</p><p class=align-left>Your male <a href=#>best friend </a>is having guests over, and who does he want to cook for his boys? You. You are doing girlfriend and wife duties, yet he cannot ask you out even once. Don't let them treat you like a rag. If they think you are not worth dating, you should not be used at their convenience. Love yourself a little, and they will think twice before using you.</p><h3>10. Demand clarity</h3><p class=align-left>When all has failed, demand clarity. There is nothing as bad as falling in love with someone who does not see you as a partner worth dating. She can check all the friendship boxes; he can be the best male friend you have ever had, but wanting more from them while being in the grey area is a bummer. Politely ask her if she likes being nice to you just as a friend or something more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs700m7k0sp76.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get a girl to like you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A clear answer is great for your well-being and will help you move forward. There are many amazing people you can pursue romantic interests with. Knowing that you are in the friend zone will make you move on swiftly and help you find people that are great for romantic relationships.</p><p class=align-left>Being aware of your position in people’s lives is crucial.
