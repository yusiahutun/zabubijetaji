saying Charlotte may have been "battling some stuff internally that no one else was aware of".</p><p>Speaking exclusively to The Sun, Marnie said: “I can’t speak for her, no one really knows what is going on in someone else's mind, but I think Jake [Ankers] was really struggling.</p><p>"I don’t think he enjoyed filming.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON GEORDIE SHORE">READ MORE ON GEORDIE SHORE</h2><p>"I don’t think he enjoyed being away with everyone, I just think it was too much for him or maybe he wasn’t prepared for it.</p><p>"It is a hard thing to do if you’re not prepared, so I think that might have been on her mind."</p><p>Marnie continued: "And then she just had a baby, you know what it’s like when you’ve just had a baby, I know – I’ve had two.</p><p>"The first year, I think is really really tough, especially the first few months.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>"So maybe she was battling some stuff herself internally that no one else was aware of, it’s just a shame that we were supposed to go away for a family friendly holiday, we were all supposed to have fun and it just didn’t turn out like that.”</p><p>When asked if she thinks Charlotte would ever return, Newcastle lass Marnie admitted that it would make her "look silly" if she decided to make a comeback but said the cast would "welcome her back with open arms".</p><p>"I think she would look silly if she ever did come back because of how much she said she’s said she’s not going to come back," Marnie told us.</p><p>"But the doors always open.</p><p>"The amount of Geordie’s that have left and come back, the list is endless.</p><p>"I mean if she ever came back, everyone would welcome her with open arms.</p><p>"We’d all be there, I’m always there to have a conversation, I would never not want to make amends, I’m a fair person, it is what it is.”</p><p>But Marnie made it clear that she would not be the first to reach out to Charlotte, despite her being open for reconciliation.</p><p>Marnie said: "Me and Charlotte don’t speak no, I don’t hold a grudge, I wish her all the best and if I see her walking down the street, I would say hello.
