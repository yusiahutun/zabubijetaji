She was born on February 20, 2021. “Sterling Skye Mahomes 👸🏼 2/20/21 6lbs 11oz,” Matthews captioned an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post at the time of her wearing as “Sterling” necklace as Sterling held Mahomes’ finger.&nbsp; “Sterling Skye Mahomes 2/20/21 ❤️,” Mahomes captioned the same post.</p><p>Mahomes celebrated Sterling’s first birthday in 2022 with an <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> slideshow of him and his daughter. One photo showed Sterling in a T-shirt that read: “My daddy plays football better than your daddy.” In an interview with the “Rich Eisen Show” in 2021, Mahomes talked about how he wants to be as present in his daughter’s life as possible no matter how busy his schedule is.</p><p>“I made it home just in time before her bedtime, so she was in her bedtime routine. I got to kind of just go in and give her a little kiss goodnight, so it was definitely cool to get to go home and see her,” he said. He also told the show at the time about how he was trying to get sterling’s first word to be “dada” instead of “mama.”&nbsp; “She is saying, ‘Ah-Ah,’ which to me is like really close to dada. But Brittany says it’s really close to mama. So we’re kind of battling that one out, too. I’m saying dada in every third word of my sentences,” Mahomes said.</p><p>Mahomes told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Today</a> in 2021 about why they didn’t post a photo of Sterling’s face on Instagram for the first three months after her birth. “Obviously at first we wanted to keep stuff private and not have her out there,” he said. “As we started doing different things and she started getting a little bit older, being out and about, it almost became like a burden to try to hide her at all times when we do stuff, and this coming season we want her to be at the games and not have to worry about hiding her the entire time.” He continued, “We figured it was about time. We still want to keep some stuff private, but we figured we can show everybody her face at least once or twice or not have to keep hiding her.”</p><p>He also told Today about how he understands what it’s like to grow up in the public eye after having a father who’s a former Major League Baseball player. (Mahomes’ dad, Pat Homes, as a MLB player for the&nbsp;Minnesota Twins, Boston Red Sox, New York Mets, Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs, and Pittsburgh Pirates.)</p><p>“I think I have a little bit of an understanding because my dad played professional sports, but it’s going to be a little different in the social media age and everything like that,” Mahomes said. “We just want to give her the most normal life that she possibly can so she can grow and have friends and learn and get better and better every single day.” He continued, “There will be points where she’ll be in the public eye, and we have a great understanding of that. Luckily we’re in Kansas City where there’s a lot of great people that she’ll be in a great place as she grows up.”</p><p>Mahomes also told Today about the most important lesson he learned about being a parent at the time.&nbsp;“We learned the two most important words in being parents is ‘sleep schedule,'” he said. “We have the sleep schedule down. She’s actually a really good sleeper. She already sleeps through the night. She wakes up about at 6 a.m, just about when I wake up usually.”</p><p>He continued, “It’s been amazing. Brittany’s been a champ, she’s been the best mom ever, so I’m just excited every single day for the new challenges and seeing [Sterling] grow.” Still, Mahomes told Today that there was still a lot left for him to learn about being a parent.&nbsp; “There’s moments when she’s crying and Brittany’s at the store or in the shower or something like that, and I have no idea what to do after I try all the tricks,” he said. “Luckily enough there hasn’t been too many of those moments.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfpa61vsicomalkZ28rrHSZqKinKNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hardy-tops-the-list-of-nominees-for-the-2023-acm-awards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hardy Tops The List Of Nominees For The 2023 ACM Awards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ahs-american-horror-story-1984-recap-slasher-supernatural.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'American Horror Story: 1984' Recap Season 9, Episode 2: Slasher Saga Goes Supernatural</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
