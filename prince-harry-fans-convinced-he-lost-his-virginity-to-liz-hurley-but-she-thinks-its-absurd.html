But fans are convinced Prince Harry’s first time was with actress Liz Hurley – who has responded to the rumors.</strong></p><p>The 39-year-old didn’t hold back when reminiscing about his memories of growing up in the <a href=#>royal</a> family in his autobiography. He dished about <a href=#>meeting Meghan for the first time</a> and losing his mother, the late <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>. No subject was off-limits, that was for sure. Considering his book was written by a ghostwriter, some conversations may have been awkward, with <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> explaining every detail for the writer to jot down in the final copy. Many readers are still haunted by the frostbite incident. If you know, you know. So when Prince Harry described losing his virginity, and the woman it was with, fans have connected the dots to actress Liz Hurley. But what does the <a href=#>celebrity</a> herself have to say about it?</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duke-describes-his-first-special-encounter>Duke describes his first special encounter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1392493520-1024x757.jpg><p>Theories on the identity of the mystery woman who was the young Haz’s first encounter have been at the forefront of some fans’ minds for the past two years.</p><p>Despite the Duke, brother to <a href=#>Prince William</a>, going into detail – the type of detail that makes the reader unconsciously imagine it in their head whether they want to or not – we don’t know who it is.</p><p>Harry – married to <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> – and the mystery older woman have never confirmed it.</p><p>Writing in his book, which hit shelves in January 2022, he described his first sexual encounter.</p><p>He says it took place in 2001, when the royal would have been 16 or 17 and attending Eton at the time. Following in his brother and father, <a href=#>King Charles</a>‘, footsteps by studying at the school.</p><p>He described the moment he popped his cherry, saying it was a ‘humiliating episode’ with an older woman.</p><p>Harry said she “liked horses a lot and treated me like a young stallion”.</p><p>He wrote: “I mounted her quickly, after which she spanked me on the backside and sent me on my way. One of my many errors was to do it in a&nbsp;field, just behind a crowded pub.”</p><p>A master of words.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-and-liz-hurley-are-connected-say-fans>Prince Harry and Liz Hurley are connected, say fans</h2><p>After people read Spare, they’ve been trying to Sherlock Holmes the answer to the big question. Who was it? Did Liz Hurley pop Prince Harry’s cherry?</p><p>The 58-year-old has been named amid the rumors and speculation, and she’s had her say on the matter.</p><p>At the time, Liz would have been 36, and Hurley was a big name, starring alongside <a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a> and Mike Myers in Austin Powers, and would have been older than Prince Harry.</p><p>But the <a href=#>movie</a> star denies meeting H in a countryside pub and getting frisky with the prince.</p><p>When she appeared on Watch What Happens Live, she put the rumors to bed – pardon the pun.</p><p>She told Andy Cohen: “That [the rumor] was ludicrous!</p><p>“He said, ‘She was English, she was older than me, it was in Gloucestershire’. And people were like, ‘Ah, it’s Elizabeth’.</p><p>“It was absurd. It was ridiculous.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> starlet said she had “never” met Prince Harry, so it’d be hard for Liz Hurley to take his virginity if that was the case.</p><p>However, there is some invisible string between her and Harry regardless. The Duchess of Sussex said she had a ‘girl crush’ on the actress on her now-deleted blog The Tig in 2015.</p><p>Two years before she met the love of her life, and would go on to share <a href=#>Archie and Lilibet</a>, she said she was fond of Liz after seeing her famous Versace dress that was held together by gold safety pins.</p><p>There you have it.</p><p>Maybe we’ll never know who took the Duke’s Crown Jewels.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2WDcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GadmqajYrCwutWipZydlGK1pnnLqKqtZZiewG7CyKueoqaZqcZuwM5mo6KyXZ3Cs7jEsmSbraRiwKmxjK2foqabqHqqwNJmmJurpaexcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sierra-gates-net-worth-kids-weight-loss-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sierra Gates Net Worth, Kids, Weight Loss, Husband</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carrie-underwood-video-singing-baby-son-isaiah-113513.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>OMG!Carrie Underwood Shares a Cute Video of Herself Singing With Her Baby Son, Isaiah</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
