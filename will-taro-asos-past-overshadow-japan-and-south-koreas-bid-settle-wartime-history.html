He is also expected to express his condolences for the people who <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">died during Halloween celebrations</span></a> in the Itaewon district of the city this past weekend.<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Japan</span></a> has long held the position that the issue of compensation for former labourers at Japanese corporations during the 1910-1945 colonial period was settled under the 1965 agreement that normalised diplomatic relations and saw Tokyo pay redress. A series of court rulings in Korea in recent years, including at the Supreme Court level, have disagreed with that position and ordered a number of Japanese firms to compensate former labourers.<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Both sides now agree they want to solve this problem and the visit by Aso is significant as he is the former prime ministerYuji Hosaka, Sejong University</figure>Under Tokyo’s instructions, those firms resisted making payments and, as a result, courts ordered the seizure of their assets in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">South Korea</span></a>. A final decision on liquidating those holdings to provide compensation to the former labourers is believed to be imminent and both sides are keen for an agreement to be reached before that point.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Both sides now agree they want to solve this problem and the visit by Aso is significant as he is the former prime minister, a former foreign and finance minister and even today he is vice-president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,” said Yuji Hosaka, a professor specialising in Japan-Korea relations at Sejong University in South Korea.</p>There have been suggestions in recent weeks that the solution may take the form of a fund that companies will be invited to pay into, with the proceeds being distributed among the victims, Hosaka told <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">This Week in Asia</span></a>, although he pointed out that there has so far been no mention of Japanese companies contributing to the fund in Japan. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2022/08/16/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:30</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Marking 77 years since end of WWII, Japanese leader says nation will never again wage war</p><p>Marking 77 years since end of WWII, Japanese leader says nation will never again wage war</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stephen Nagy, an associate professor of international relations at Tokyo’s International Christian University, agreed that Aso’s “gravitas” within the Japanese government underlines Japan’s desire to reach a lasting solution to the problem and the former prime minister will be able to unequivocally state Tokyo’s position.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is now good potential for some kind of behind-closed-doors solution that can be used by both sides to provide a cover for a compromise agreement,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Criticism from some quarters is “inevitable”, Nagy said, but added: “If both sides can come away with something that is a compromise, then both will be able to say that the biggest achievement is that they are moving forward.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Will North Korea turn Tokyo and Seoul from foes to ‘natural allies’?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hosaka points out, however, that while most Koreans know little about Aso, the South Korean media can be certain to comment on his own family’s links to forced labourers.</p>Aso only finally admitted in 2009 that his family business had used forced labourers and POWs during World War II. The issue had come up two years earlier, when Tokyo applied to have a number of locations linked to its industrial heritage added to the Unesco list of World Heritage sites, although the application to the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">UN</span></a> body made no mention of the use of forced labourers.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was also learned that Aso Mining Co had used at least 300 POWs in its mines, and as many as 10,000 Korean forced labourers. Aso initially denied his family’s involvement until presented with documentation, whereupon he claimed he could not be held accountable as he was a child during the war.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aso was himself chairman of Aso Mining from 1973 to 1979, when he went into politics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hosaka is hopeful that Aso may make another apology which, coming from a former prime minister and a senior member of a family that employed foreign labourers, might carry additional weight in Seoul.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China envoy blasts US for dividing Seoul and Beijing, defends Hu’s congress exit</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Comments on social media are less optimistic, with many suggesting Aso might have been sent to Seoul with instructions to dig his heels in and insist South Korea bend to Japan’s position on the matter, although others were more concerned with his well-documented ability to say the wrong thing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Aso has in the past caused outrage by blaming the nation’s woes on unmarried people because “they don’t give birth” and described Japan as the perfect place for “rich Jews” to live.</p>He has similarly called on elderly people to “hurry up and die” because they are a drain on the nation’s resources and, after <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China</span></a> complained about plans to release water from the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Fukushima nuclear plant</span></a> into the Pacific Ocean, insisted the water is safe for humans to drink.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZK6zwMico55nY2aGeX2TbGawoZyherWt0ahkmqufqHqxrdKtZKiulafAqa3DqK5mopGlrq95wKebZqufqsGpecqoqZ6Zo2KvqrCMrJytrJyaerit0a2gpp1dnba0wM6rsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashleigh-banfield-husband-salary-net-worth-house.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ashleigh Banfield Husband, Salary, Net Worth &amp;amp; House</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-taylor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Taylor - Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Facts, Nationality</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
