When asked about what kind of tech product she uses in her daily life, she revealed that it's Alexa.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>"Alexa tell the writer to cut to the chase..."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Okay, sure!</p><p>She further revealed that her spouse mostly uses Alexa to listen to music, and how does she know it, you ask?&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I know this because I can look on the Alexa app while I’m at work and see what he’s been playing.

You do need to be attentive to your spouse; after all, that's what keeps the love going.&nbsp;</p><p>Jokes apart, Katie seems to live a very healthy marriage with her mysterious spouse, and while he might be in the dark from the media light, it is certain that the pair lives a happy life together.&nbsp;</p><p>Born to Asian&nbsp;parents, she possesses Asian ethnicity, but her origin was highlighted negatively when Benner landed herself in a controversy back in July 2021.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Katie Benner a Communist Spy?</h2><p>As much absurd as the title sounds, that is exactly the accusation that Katie had to face. The Pulitzer Prize winner called out Trump supporters for being "enemies of the state" on a series of tweets.&nbsp;</p><p>The tweet that has now been deleted created a huge debate on the online platform, and in no time, words began spreading that she was an operative of the Chinese Communist Party.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Tweet About Katie Benner Accused Of Being A Chinese Communist Party Operative" height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/Katie-Benner-1.jpg width=483 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Tweet About Katie Benner Accused Of Being A Chinese Communist Party Operative </strong>(Source <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>However, these claims were proved to be baseless by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Misbar,&nbsp;</a>and the site revealed that the only reason she was even subjected to such speculation was that she once wrote for The Bejing&nbsp;Review.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Benner does not have much association with the country itself as she was born in Vermont and did her studies in Maine.
