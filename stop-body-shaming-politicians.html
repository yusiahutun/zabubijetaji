I found a therapist and a dietician and a group; I spent hours every week talking about food and body issues. I learned that for me, the cessation of my eating disorder depended on the cessation of the thing that caused it: shame. Specifically, shame I felt about the way I looked which motivated each descent into the binge-restrict cycle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The way to get rid of shame is to pull it out of the dark and talk about it, which is exactly the opposite thing you feel like doing when you experience shame. It’s a distressing enough process that my subconscious originally thought an eating disorder would be preferable—the option to distract and numb seems a much surer (and more pleasant) means of survival than having to wade slowly through the pain.</p><img alt="Chrissy Stockton" title="Chrissy Stockton" width=960 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-0488-1521060810.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Chrissy Stockton</span><p>"Body shaming is now part of our media diet as we engage in debates and collective <span class=redactor-unlink>fascination</span> over how much the president weighs," writes the author</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A woman I met in one of my groups summed it up. She was my mother’s age and had a good marriage and grown children who loved her. She was healthy after surviving a battle with cancer. Each of these things ticked off my biggest insecurities, the things that made me think “If I just had what she has I would be happy with myself.” But nearly <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://quotecatalog.com/quote/brene-brown-even-with-all-o-O1Me9Z1/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="90 percent of women feel some sense of shame about their body" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">90 percent of women feel some sense of shame about their body</a>, so it wasn’t too surprising to learn that even a loving husband and adoring children and a clean bill of health can’t insulate you.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I feel like I’m a monster,” she said, “When I look at my body, I feel like I am looking at a monster’s body.

As much as I empathize with the woman in my group, I also recognized that her vision was obstructed by her eating disorder. No sane person would think she was unlovable. And yet, when I tried to fact-check whether my own thoughts were rational, I thought of the ways my internal dialogue sounded just like the commentary surrounding the Chris Christie story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">People think my thighs look like ham hocks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">People hate looking at me and wish I’d hide my body so they wouldn’t have to see it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">People are disgusted by my body, they just won’t say it because I’m nice to them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s not just the beach story.

We also probably won’t harm the intended target, because their narcissism or celebrity makes the insult unlikely to reach them or be absorbed. But we will hurt plenty of other people. Our friends and loved ones are listening to what we say (along with strangers we might not care directly about, but definitely don’t intend to harm) and taking in information about their own worthiness from how we judge the bodies of others.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="body-tip css-uhdxbj emevuu60">"I'm not asking you to be kind to a politician’s body because the politician deserves it, but rather, because everyone else does."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I'm not asking people to be kind to a politician’s body because the politician deserves it, but rather, because everyone else does. It’s about having awareness of who is reading the words and what the story says about what we, as a culture, find acceptable or unacceptable. When someone talks about how someone’s body is unacceptable it doesn’t happen in a vacuum and intentionally or not you’re going to shame anyone listening who is going to compare their own body to the intended target’s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m still here.
