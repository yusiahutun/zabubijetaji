That being said, we'll buy more because we can't deny their ability to elevate any outfit. “Tights are an essential part of every woman’s wardrobe,” says stylist Michaela Leitz, and I couldn’t agree more. To shopping for black tights easier (and ensure you'll find pairs you actually like), we identified 28 top-rated styles and put them to the test in our lab.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;We didn’t just test them based on style, though — these tights had to endure being dragged over velcro, poked around with jewelry, and being pulled, tugged, and twisted in all kinds of ways. We even took a tiny knife in an attempt to cut a hole in those that passed everything else. In putting them through the ringer (figuratively and literally) we analyzed the stretch, comfort, and opaqueness of each to find the best of the best. These pairs are so good, you might even be able to get more than one season out of them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-spanx-tight-end-tights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Tight-End Tights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Tight-End Tights" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EidJd_PxMfB7kjzSeQkSNqKyeFE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-tight-end-tights-2f869fe94c2642609824513ac00120b9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What made the Spanx Tight-End Tights land our Best Overall spot lies majorly in their comfort and durability. Right as we pulled these on, we were impressed with how soft and stretchy they felt, and how smoothly they glided over legs. The waistband lands slightly above the waistline with an exceptionally comfortable stretch. “These definitely feel like a luxe pair of tights,” our tester says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The tights do a great job at elongating legs by hugging curves in all the right places. They’re fairly opaque, but hints of skin still peek through (check out the option below from Calzedonia if you want fully opaque tights). When tested against both soft and rough velcro, we did notice that the fabric was completely unbothered by the former, but it lightly pilled against the latter. However, no breakage or runs occurred. Regardless, we were extremely pleased with the overall look and durability — and we’re not the only ones. For many professional stylists, including Michaela Leitz, Spanx tights are a go-to. “The quality is good, and Spanx even produces tights without mid-thigh shaper to wear [with] short hemlines,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>A-E<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Cotton-lined gusset, nylon, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte<strong> </strong>| <strong>Opacity: </strong>Medium | <strong>Rise: </strong>High<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hm-tights-200-denier></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H&M Tights 200 Denier</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="H&amp;amp;M Tights 200 Denier" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WM-r9A3xmVad6FK4_Qm6d-r2llg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hm-tights-200-denier-9ee331c0155b4bbbafb6e59ad4c73d2e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>H&M</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For $13, these tights left quite an impression on us. To begin, they are extremely stretchy: “I felt like they could stretch almost across [and entire] room and still maintain the original length,” our tester says. For our long legged ladies, you won’t find yourself forcefully pulling every bit of stretch over your legs. Not only that, but they are also surprisingly warm.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some of our reviewers are very familiar with these tights — with a few of them saying they’ve owned this pair for over three years, which speaks volumes to their durability. When we put them to the test, we found that the rough velcro did cause some pilling on the fabric. That said, we didn’t spot any rips or runs, not even when we poked around with a handful of rings. While they are opaque, they don’t have that same luxe feel as the option above, but if you’re looking for sturdy, stretchy, warm tights, then these are it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;<strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex |<strong> Finish: </strong>Matte<strong> </strong>|<strong> Opacity: </strong>Opaque<strong> </strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-wolford-merino-tights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wolford Merino Tights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wolford Merino Tights" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VHS2FR8g1f8sC1DBe75Lp7_A_5s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wolford-merino-tights-for-women-616b58bdeb9d4c8a9dd8b11815106915.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just by looking at these tights, you can immediately tell each aspect was created with intention and craftsmanship. First off, they’re made with 50 percent wool, making them extra soft and warm. (The other 50 percent is nylon, which gives them their stretch.) They also have a high opacity — only a tiny bit of skin shows when stretched out. Another stand out feature of the tights is how they conform to your body: The waistband self-adjusts to snuggly fit around your midsection without its shape when nicely stored away.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the tear test, the tights performed relatively well against velcro and jewelry, only showing a few minor runs. They did, however, finally rip when we pulled a finger nimble over it. To be fair, that is a literal knife cutting a hole into tights, so as long as you avoid sharp objects, the tights should last a long time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;Even though they’re higher-priced than other tights on this list, our tester says she would purchase them because the value is impeccable. “Not only are these easy to put on and feel really comfortable on the skin (not itchy at all), but they’re also very durable.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;<strong>Size: </strong>S-L<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Wool, nylon, elastane | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Opacity: </strong>Opaque | <strong>Rise: </strong>High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-semi-sheer-skims-full-control-tights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Semi-Sheer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SKIMS Full Control Tights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WTv9kVKMJFGRmaY0vzsPgj_f3TA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-full-control-tights-6f0f122a6158410aa354ad96142bca1f.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We had high expectations for these tights, and we’re happy to report that they did not disappoint. “These definitely exceeded my expectations,” says our tester. “I was pleasantly surprised that the hype around the brand wasn’t all talk.” In true Skims fashion, these tights mesh style with functionality: The thick waistband provides great support around the midsection and upper thighs thanks to the built in control top that smooths and sculpts the body. We love that they come in such a wide range of sizes, with a detailed size guide to help you find the right fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So long as you avoid velcro, these tights will last you a long time. It put up a strong fight against sharp nails and finger claws, but a light tug against velcro and it started to show a few tears. All in all, we think these are some of the most versatile tights on our list as they can be worn with casual outfits and double as unassuming shapewear on special occasions.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;<strong>Size: </strong>XXS-4XL |<strong> Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane |<strong> Finish: </strong>Matte |<strong> Opacity: </strong>Semi-sheer | <strong>Rise: </strong>High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-opaque-calzedonia-100-denier-total-comfort-soft-touch-tights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Opaque</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calzedonia Soft Touch Tights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NffBTseYyXGtFaouXAo68nTGLVg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/calzedonia-100-denier-total-comfort-soft-touch-tights--96bc0913046f421caf24d9953405b547.jpg"><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This option from Calzedonia is as close as you can get to blackout tights. When stretched against a light in our lab, we noticed some shine come through (they are tights, after all) but they were the most full-coverage pair we tested. The waistband is wide and comfortable, and snugly fits around your midsection. For less than $20, these tights are an affordable, no-frills option that provides adequate leg coverage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the low price tag, they do withstand velcro and other sharp objects quite well. “Surprisingly, the tights didn't tear at all after I ran it with the finger nimble,” our tester syas. We recommend turning to this option when you just need a little leg coverage but aren’t necessarily wearing tights day in and day out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;<strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyamide, elastane, cotton | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte | <strong>Opacity: </strong>Opaque<strong> </strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>Mid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-control-top-jcrew-control-top-opaque-tights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Control Top</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Control-Top Opaque Tights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J Crew Control-Top Opaque Tights" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/U8b4gpNs34Oemf75D727W3cteWo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/j-crew-control-top-opaque-tights-ddeb9a15ad264690b34d94210afd10e5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.

On top of providing great support, they seem to stretch endlessly without ever losing their original shape. On top of maintaining their silhouette, they also remain opaque, even when stretched to extremes. “These bad boys are stretchy!” says our tester. “I was able to stretch them two arms length, which I was not expecting for a size XS.” Despite being uber stretchy, we did notice that they run a little small — so for the most comfortable fit size up. While elastic and pretty durable, we did notice that a strong nail could poke a hole in this fabric. They did, however, put up a strong fight against the soft and hard velcro. Only mild markings were left by the latter, but nothing noticeable enough to throw them out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;<strong>Size: </strong>XS-L |<strong> Material:</strong> Nylon, spandex | <strong>Finish: </strong>Matte<strong> </strong>|<strong> Opacity: </strong>Opaque<strong> </strong>|<strong> Rise: </strong>High</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sheer-commando-sexy-sheer-tights></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sheer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Commando Sexy Sheer Tights</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Commando Sexy Sheer Tights" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FlHdQJZKkW7vuYt5IhRnVT-19BI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/commando-sexy-sheer-tights-b6864a361d57442f91ae72dd85e430c7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Commando</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Stretch</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opaqueness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>They tear easily.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For our fashionably forward friends, these are the tights to turn to for an evening out. They stretch well over the leg, providing comfort from top to bottom. Even the waistband — despite its lacy texture — feels comfortable around the stomach. As the cheeky name suggests, these tights add a sexy edge to any outfit.

While they’re not high-waisted, they sit right above the belly button and smooth out your tummy without feeling uncomfortable. Because of the shaping abilities, they’re also extremely durable. As a matter of fact, they're probably the second most durable option on this list, next to our best rip-resistant tights (below). No velcro, jewelry, or nails were able to create visible harm to the fabric.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In order to provide such support, however, it does mean that they’re not as stretchy as other tights.

While we don’t recommend doing that at home (you don’t want to ruin them after all), this is one pair you could actually stretch from wall to wall. We did, and were pleasantly surprised to see them spring right back to their original silhouette. The stretch and elasticity are clearly next level, which means they’re also super comfortable. The elasticity is also an indicator that one size will probably fit a wide range of body types, but Wolford nevertheless a size range of XS-2XL, which we’re very grateful of.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our tester recommends these for those who “appreciate” fabric quality. “The Wolford brand has proven itself as luxurious and you can really tell the brand has a legacy for a reason,” she says. Plus, they’re a great pick for those looking for an elevated black tight as they faintly shimmer in the light.

Even after dragging rings, velcro, and sharp blades over them, there was not a rip or run in sight. “I would feel comfortable wearing these around my dog and doing multiple activities where my jewelry or bag could impact the fabric,” says our tester. Though they’re near bullet-proof, they’re still stretchy, though they require an extra tug to pull them over your legs.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to note, however, is that these are pretty opaque rather than being sheer.

Let us introduce you to A New Day Women's 120D Blackout Tights. Similar to the last option, these tights can stretch for days along the leg without much resistance, but at a fraction of the cost — though you’d never expect it. “I had no idea how much these tights would cost, and assumed they were more expensive than they were,” says our tester. They’re durable, too: The hard velcro and nail left some markings during our rip test, but not enough to write them off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the legs went on for days, the waistband did not come with as much of a stretch.

We really had to go above and beyond to get them to rip, which is quite impressive for tights that are only $12. The stretch-appeal is hit or miss, though. While they have good elasticity along the leg, the waistline is not as stretchy as the other options listed above. Our tester recommends these for people who wish to smooth out their stomach, or simply don’t have much of one to begin with. “These tights deliver crazy value,” she says. “They will last the test of time for people who want a control top.” No elasticity around the waist naturally makes them less comfortable, but considering how good they look for how little they cost, they’re a great go-to piece when you need something last minute for an event.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"><strong>HUE Super Opaque Tights with Control Top</strong></a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of rip-resistance, these tights are quite impressive. It took several passes with the finger nimble to even make a hole appear. As advertised, they also provide a nice control top — they wrap snugly around the waist and smooth out the midsection. However, this does mean that there is very little stretch in the waistband. On the other hand, it stretches almost too much around the legs. When pulled apart, the length of the tights never returned to its original starting point. Therefore, it is likely that they will get worn out relatively quickly.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Tamara Staples</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The most important thing to look for in tights is the material.

For this test, we measured the opacity both on the body and while stretched against a light.

Opaque tights are typically thicker and provide a little more warmth. They are great options for the winter, and for occasions that call for a formal dress code.

Stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="nofollow nocaes">Michaela Leitz</a> seconds the sneaker opinion. “Tights can be dressed for any occasion — from casual with sneakers or flats, to chic with heels or boots,” she says.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I style black tights?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tights are not a replacement for pants in the same way leggings are. You will definitely need something to cover your bottoms with, whether that’s a dress or a skirt. You can wear a long, oversized sweater or shirt, but we still recommend wearing some type of shorts underneath, just in case the wind comes to betray you. “When paired with the right amount of skirt/shirt coverage, black tights can create the elongating effect that petite gals like myself want!” says professional fashion stylist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Kara Fabella</a>. Sheer tights, such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Commando Sheer Tights</a>, look great paired with a mini dress and some heels. A blazer, skirt, tights, and loafer combo, on the other hand, look best with semi-sheer tights or more opaque styles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What do I do with ripped tights?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t immediately give up on your ripped tights! Sanchez has a way to give them a second life: By distressing them even further. “The 2023 runways were all about that torn up look, so go ahead and ravage your oldest pair with a few carefully placed rips and tears.” Some combat boots, a dress with frills, or a plaid skirt make excellent companions to distressed tights.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What does denier mean for tights?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ve probably seen this term thrown around when reading up on tights. Denier is a measurement of thickness on individual yarns used in fabrics. The higher the number, the thicker, and therefore, warmer the material. “I normally choose denier level 30 to 100 during spring and autumn, and in winter I go up to 200 denier (almost as thick as a yoga pant),” explains Leitz. In tights, it also speaks to the opacity of the material. The less thread count there is, the more sheer the tights and vice versa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-instyle-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is InStyle Picks?<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you notice the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle Picks seal of approval</a>&nbsp;at the top of this story?
