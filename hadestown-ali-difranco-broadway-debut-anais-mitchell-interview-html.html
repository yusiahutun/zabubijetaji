Mitchell sang the part of Eurydice opposite Justin Vernon’s Orpheus, and she tapped DiFranco for Persephone, Hades’s vernal goddess wife.

In some ways, this is a brand-new direction for the “32 Flavors” singer, but in a fittingly mythical hero’s journey way, it’s also a return to a character that she helped create. Vulture sat down with DiFranco and Mitchell while they essentially interviewed each other just down the street from the Walter Kerr Theatre to discuss creative mentorship and relating to Persephone.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7qoz6t001z3j8314mz4fwk@published data-word-count=25><strong>What has it been like for you to return to this project and this role now that it has taken on such a larger life?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7qptti00253j83ue1bf4u7@published data-word-count=91><strong>Ani DiFranco: </strong>It’s really cool. All those years while you were gathering a badass crew around you and evolving it beyond anybody’s wildest dreams, I was touring and doing my scrappy little folk-singer thing and marveling at what you were up to. I haven’t played a big role in the making of Hadestown, but I feel like a fairy godmother: I got you your little shoes and your little dress and I sent you off to the ball. As the little fairy godmother, I’m just so excited to be invited back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/944/2c4/b7c474c3bc662a2f4b7b8035b31a71a945-ani-difranco-hadestown.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7qtrcf002b3j83qtkrf4o7@published data-word-count=140><strong>Anaïs Mitchell: </strong>Ani, I don’t want to embarrass you, but I would maybe not have picked up the guitar was it not for your songs. The first songs I learned on the guitar in high school were Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and “Both Hands.” You were such a mythical figure for me. Creatively, politically, business-wise, you showed me the way as an aspiring songwriter, because you were at the forefront of this movement in indie music, where you didn’t wait to get discovered or to get someone’s permission to make an album. You just scrape together the money, you make a record, you tour it, you sell it out of your car until you make enough money to make another one. That’s what I did, and then a couple of records in, I met you at a bar in Buffalo.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7r15dr002l3j83rttwtqsg@published data-word-count=17><strong>AD: </strong>I showed up at Nietzsche’s and watched you play, and immediately wanted to get behind you.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7r47lm002r3j83hz0hmf09@published data-word-count=149><strong>AM: </strong>You signed me to your label right away, and the second full-length album I made with Righteous Babe was Hadestown. I was a virtually unknown songwriter, and I was like, “I’m gonna do a double record, and it’s a concept album about Greek mythology.” It was cool of you and your label to be like, “Great, we will give you money to make that.” Ani was the first person I asked to sing on the record, as Persephone. You had not even heard the music, but right away you said yes, and your leap of faith blew open the door to a cascade of yeses. Had you not said yes to the album early on, there’s no way to know what path this piece would have taken. Would we be here in midtown, talking about you taking over the role for Broadway? It’s an almost unimaginable full-circle situation.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7rfeuj002x3j83wixlvkqm@published data-word-count=10><strong>AD: </strong>I believe that you would have made it happen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7rguke00333j836mam3zvk@published data-word-count=9><strong>Why is now the time to return to Persephone?</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7rhf3v00393j83kp03sy42@published data-word-count=62><strong>AM: </strong>It’s not only your role in the genesis of the show, but just who you you are in the culture. I’ve always equated you with the Persephone character. She’s evolved since the album: She’s empathetic for Orpheus, and she’s fun, she likes to party, and she is a revolutionary. That’s who you’ve always been to me: bold and brave and fun.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7rjjvo003f3j839dygx7ev@published data-word-count=52><strong>AD: </strong>And a bit of a provider. Not that I have much, but one of my favorite things is giving beautiful souls and performers and musical beings and artists that fall outside conventional realms a little leg up, in sort of an ethereal mentor role.

For a woman a few years older than me to extend a hand and a leg up to a younger woman is almost too rare. And Persephone does that for Eurydice. That’s where I’m at now: I feel like Persephone, but I’m not quite comfortable with it. I’ve seen older folks, and now me, identify with what it’s like to be in a partnership with someone for so many years, and Persephone and Hades struggling to find each other again, and then having this renaissance of their love.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp7s7har00533j83dqy4gho2@published data-word-count=18><strong>AD: </strong>I don’t want to rush you into that one.
