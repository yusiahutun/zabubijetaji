Over three-quarters are produced for the meat industry, in particular in China, the US and Brazil, for two main reasons: for metaphylaxis, to enable farm animals to survive their brief but drab lives in industry-scale farms; and to fatten them up faster, so they can reach slaughter weight more quickly and profitably.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over the past two decades, increasing numbers of health experts have raised the alarm over the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Hong Kong’s own Dr Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun, when she was head of the World Health Organisation, was vocal among them: “In the absence of urgent corrective and protective actions, the world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era, in which many common infections will no longer have a cure and, once again, kill unabated.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the US, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 2.8 million Americans get antibiotic-resistant infections every year, and 35,000 people die from them, adding billions to the country’s medical costs.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why superbugs in Hong Kong are a concern and what’s to be done</span></p></a></h3>That may not seem so many alongside the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">100,000 that have died</span></a> in the US this spring from Covid-19, but it is enough for the CDC to call antibiotic resistance one of the world’s most pressing public health problems.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over the past century, first penicillin and then antibiotics like tetracycline and amoxicillin have played a huge role in suppressing illnesses from Lyme disease and syphilis to pneumonia and tuberculosis. But no new class of antibiotics has been discovered in the past four decades, making the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) annually more alarming.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The British government’s national action plan for the AMR crisis, published in January 2019, reported that 700,000 people were dying worldwide every year because antibiotics were losing their effectiveness, and that this number would rise to 10 million a year by 2050, with a cumulative cost of US$100 trillion, if firm action was not taken.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report predicted that even with strong restrictions, the <span class="c2 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>total consumption of antimicrobials would triple by 2030. It laid plans to reduce human use of antimicrobials in Britain by 15 per cent by 2024, and cut animal use by 25 per cent by this year, but there has been no subsequent report on progress.</span></p>But progress in Britain – or in Europe for that matter, where a total ban on animal use of antimicrobials is due to come into force in 2022 – is of limited value, when according to the US’ National Academy of Sciences, the world’s biggest users of antibiotics in industrial farming are in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China</span></a> (23 per cent), the US (13 per cent) and Brazil (9 per cent).<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">More worryingly, the big increases in future use are expected to arise in China (30 per cent of global use by 2030), and in a clutch of developing economies that don’t even yet appear in the rankings – like Myanmar, Indonesia, Nigeria and Peru.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Could coronavirus outbreak spark a rise in global food prices?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One interesting result of the meat industry crisis in the US appears to have been an explosion of people experimenting with plant-based meat alternatives like Impossible Foods or OmniPork.</p>Nielsen reported a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">264 per cent jump</span></a> in US consumption in the nine weeks to May 2. And some are predicting that a global industry for plant-based alternatives to meat will grow to US$40 billion by 2025.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That seems impressive, but remember that the global meat industry was worth about US$946 billion in 2018, according to Statista, and is forecast to rise to U$1.14 trillion by 2023. So what might seem like good progress for vegans with a penchant for meaty textures is unlikely to make much of a dent in the global meat industry in general, or its antibiotic addiction in particular.</p>Perhaps more impactful will be decisions being taken by some of the food giants not to go vegan, but to wean themselves off factory farming. Groups like Tyson, JBS and Cargill say they are taking steps to eliminate reliance on antibiotics, along with restaurant chains like McDonald's and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">KFC</span></a>, which have begun to make commitments to phase out antibiotic use in healthy animals.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In view of Europe’s 2022 ban, that might seem like pragmatic good sense, but it is worth remembering that an increasing number of carnivores are willing to pay a price premium for meat from animals that have been raised more humanely, so there may be profits in the shift.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But at the end of the day, as we observe the chaotic response to the Covid-19 pandemic, I remain sceptical about our ability to anticipate and respond appropriately to the next animal-originated pandemic, and about our capacity to either cut factory farming or fight the food industry’s antibiotic addiction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After all, the main drivers of factory farming – and the appetite for meat – are relentless population growth and rising wealth. Our food industry may be sincere in its good intentions, but are good intentions not what paved the road to Hell?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">David Dodwell researches and writes about global, regional and Hong Kong challenges from a Hong Kong point of view</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGdxbmZogHC6xLGrZqiRo7GmucicZKahl53Bbq%2FOppxmnpGYwbC%2B2GadmqqdYrCptc2aZKiqXarAbsPOq6OdZaCnsrGt0Z6b</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wwe-elimination-chamber-2024-full-match-card-preview-predictions-and-possible-fight-order-1281042.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WWE Elimination Chamber 2024: Full Match Card, Preview, Predictions and Possible Fight Order</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./olympic-bobsledder-aja-evans-overcame-anxiety-following-training-accident.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Olympic Bobsledder Aja Evans Overcame Anxiety Following Training Accident</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
