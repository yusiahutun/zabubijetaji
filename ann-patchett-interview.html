"I was struck by the realisation that we don’t really know what our parents’ lives were like," Patchett says. "We may have an idea, a story we pieced together, and believe those are the facts – but they’re not." It’s those subtle shifts in understanding that Patchett – an author whose books are critically lauded yet also rise up <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/g42244281/best-new-fiction-books-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the bestseller charts" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the bestseller charts</a> – is so skilled at portraying.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tom Lake takes its title from an imaginary theatre company that had a formative influence on its protagonist, Lara. As a young woman, she had aspired to a career as an actress and starred as Emily in Thornton Wilder’s 1938 play, 'Our Town' – a classic tale of small-town American life.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Master the Art: Michaela Coel on how to tell a story" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/mota-thumbnail-michaela-1605025200.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the book opens in the spring of 2020 (this is a pandemic novel created with the very lightest of touches), Lara has long since abandoned her theatrical ambitions and is the mother of three grown daughters, who have just returned to the northern-Michigan family farm in a cherry orchard (there are resonances of Chekhov’s play here). Bored in pandemic isolation, the siblings find themselves delving into their mother’s past, and attempting to uncover the story of Peter Duke, a famous actor with whom Lara had shared both a stage and a romance many years before. Wilder’s play, with its insight into the nature of family and community connections, forms a rich background to Patchett’s text, which sets the longings of the past (romance, the prospect of fame) against the conflicted domestic satisfactions of the present. Is the stability of married love truly compatible with personal fulfilment?</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"We may have an idea, a story we pieced together, and believe those are the facts – but they’re not"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ever since the publication of her first novel, 1992’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-patron-saint-of-liars/ann-patchett/9781841150505 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Patron Saint of Liars" data-vars-ga-product-id=a664b402-6c92-474a-b6c4-820bb8fb77ad data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-patron-saint-of-liars/ann-patchett/9781841150505 data-product-url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-patron-saint-of-liars/ann-patchett/9781841150505 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fthe-patron-saint-of-liars%2Fann-patchett%2F9781841150505" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="HarperCollins Publishers" data-vars-ga-product-price=£12.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=a0e19d40-c33d-4b30-b9ba-bf73fd92b00e data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="HarperCollins Publishers" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">The Patron Saint of Liars</a>, Patchett has demonstrated her talent for mining the depths of human emotions.

I am interested in – imprisonment isn’t exactly the right word – what you can’t get out of. People always say, 'You’re so obsessed with the family', but that’s because you can’t get rid of them!

The pair are based in Nashville, Tennessee, where they have built a life that encompasses literature and the broadest definition of what family can be, one that crosses generations and goes beyond simple connections of blood. She has written remarkable essays about being with Karl; about caring for her grandmother Eva as she was dying; about the extraordinary relationship she forged with Sooki Raphael, a painter who also happened to be her friend Tom Hanks’ long-time assistant, and who came to Nashville to stay with Patchett and VanDevender while undergoing cancer treatment. (Raphael died in 2021; their friendship was the subject of the title essay of Patchett’s last collection, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/these-precious-days/ann-patchett/9781526640949 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="These Precious Days" data-vars-ga-product-id=0f89d290-3321-4762-9a54-fb74f43f456e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.waterstones.com/book/these-precious-days/ann-patchett/9781526640949 data-product-url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/these-precious-days/ann-patchett/9781526640949 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fthese-precious-days%2Fann-patchett%2F9781526640949" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=waterstone data-vars-ga-product-price=£9.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=22fdbd59-97ed-4be6-bc80-7e09e3683960 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=waterstone class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">These Precious Days</a>.)</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I am interested in – imprisonment isn’t exactly the right word – what you can’t get out of"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Also part of Patchett’s extended family are the customers who frequent her independent bookstore, Parnassus Books, which she co-founded in 2011. It enriches her existence, she says, by enabling her to feel part of a community far beyond her desk. "I can’t undo the wrongs of the world," she tells me, "And I don’t want to spend another second of my life trying. I do not want to spend any more of my energy on things that I cannot change. I want to change what I can. I want to put my energy into doing the good that I actually can do. I know what to do. I’m going to do it.

Simple gifts: she can write her books; she can promote the work she loves; she can connect with readers. As her fiction continually proves, a good life is one lived in small actions, day to day, and onwards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.waterstones.com/book/tom-lake/ann-patchett/9781526667106 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="‘Tom Lake’" data-vars-ga-product-id=dd67ca3a-6cb1-4df7-98b8-6f5f8af21be7 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.waterstones.com/book/tom-lake/ann-patchett/9781526667106 data-product-url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/tom-lake/ann-patchett/9781526667106 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Ftom-lake%2Fann-patchett%2F9781526667106" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=waterstone data-vars-ga-product-price=£18.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=88fec1c2-6139-446c-81a6-45f07aab5ff2 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=waterstone class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">‘Tom Lake’</a> by Ann Patchett (£18.99, Bloomsbury) is out now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This piece was originally published in the September 2023 issue of Harper's Bazaar – out now.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1rcGlgaH5xe8CnpWaokamwqbHTrWSipqSav7e1xLBm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elijah-johnson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elijah Johnson</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-city-of-helsinki-considers-buying-the-former-hartwall-arena.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The City Of Helsinki Considers Buying The Former Hartwall Arena</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
