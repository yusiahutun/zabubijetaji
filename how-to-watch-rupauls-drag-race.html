And that is a tall order for the critical mass,” she said at the time. “Most people have no idea that there is a consciousness beyond the thoughts that they think.”</p><p>She continued, “And drag is the physical embodiment of understanding who we really are. And who we really are is, for lack of a better term, God experiencing humanity, God experiencing life in human form and having fun with it. Drag takes it to the next level, which is — Oh, I can do whatever I want? Yeah, you can! Most people think, Oh, I have to choose one thing and stick with it forever.”</p><p>RuPaul also talked about how the opinion of drag was much different when RuPaul’s Drag Race first premiered in 2009. “When our show started, drag had been way underground, probably more than it had been in at least 40 years, because the Bush era of fear, 9/11 and all that was really terrible for drag. When our show started, it was part of — it wasn’t responsible for, but it was part of — this bigger movement, this opening up that came along with Obama and so many other things globally that were open,” she said.</p><p>RuPaul also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Oprah Winfrey</a> in a past interview why she was drawn to drag in the first place. “You know, I’m an opportunist and a show-off, so I knew show business would be my path,” she said. “I didn’t know how it would work, but I kept an open mind. Then I was in bands in Atlanta, and drag sort of happened to us. It was very different from the kind I do now—it was punk rock, with combat boots and smeared lipstick. But I knew I had power in drag because of the reaction I got from people.”</p><p>She also explained why drag has become so popular, especially with younger generations. “There’s a new breed of young people out there. We do a convention called DragCon, and the kids who come are smart. They’ve almost got a new belief system that’s completely of the 21st century. Our show speaks to that forward-thinking voice. They see the kids on our show overcoming adversities and realize, I can do that,” she said.</p><p>RuPaul told Money that her gowns for each season of RuPaul’s Drag Race cost around $10,000 each, with 14 gowns per season. “You know, years ago, lace-front wigs were very expensive,” she said. “They’re not as expensive anymore because they have machines that make them. But years ago, when I was buying lace-front wigs, it would be two wigs: the front, which had the lace on it, and the back, which was a support wig. It emulated your own hairline and was measured to fit your head. It was bespoke. And that would cost about $1,500 [back then]. Now you can get a lace-front wig for $80. It’s made by a machine and made for everybody, so you have to cross your fingers and hope it works.”</p><p>While she knows some numbers, RuPaul told Money that she’s never calculated the total amount she’s spend on her drag wardrobe. “I do know the end result is worth a million dollars [laughs]. It’s really all about the end result and what effect it has on people. I don’t know how much it costs. It’s a lot. It takes a lot of people. I have hair people and makeup people and people who help me get it all on. It’s a big production,” she said.</p><p>RuPaul’s Drag Race season 15<span> airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on MTV.
