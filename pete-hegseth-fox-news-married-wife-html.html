Despite&nbsp;being a two-time divorcee and a father to a child out of wedlock, he allegedly presented that to preserve the sanctity of marriage as&nbsp;one must refrain from divorce. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-195 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Well, Pete was never new to alleged dubious views, he shocked the audience in February 2019 when he revealed that he hadn’t washed his hands for ten years.</p><p>According to the TV host, germs weren’t real, and he could not&nbsp;get sick via bacteria from his hands.</p><p dir=ltr>People believe that Pete’s claims regarding family values and challenging science are to present himself as the perfect conservative.
