class=mol-para-with-font>Her attire has attracted comment before, notably when she appeared in tiny shorts and a crop top in Jumanji, while her male co-stars were more practically dressed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the time she laughed it off, saying: 'When you look at that picture out of context, it looks absurd that the woman is dressed like that and then the men are covered – but that is exactly the trope that we were highlighting in 1990s video games, this ridiculous male fantasy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The fact that the picture sparked that kind of debate I think is actually a positive thing for people to be having those conversations.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The phrase 'wardrobe malfunction' was coined after singer Janet Jackson caused outrage during the 2004 Super Bowl half-time show, when her co-star Justin Timberlake ripped off her top, exposing one of her breasts, covered with a nipple shield. Although many commentators believe the stunt was planned, Timberlake sought to quell the controversy by saying he was 'sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2016, Fifty Shades Of Gray star Dakota Johnson was collecting a prize in LA when the strap of her top snapped, prompting her to joke: 'It's not like nobody here hasn't already seen my boobs.'</p><img id=i-dabd79039837b6b5 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/03/11/22/68592353-11849035-image-a-16_1678573257728.jpg height=456 width=634 alt="Chat: The 35-year-old Doctor Who star said she enjoyed working on a lower-budget film rather than a Marvel blockbuster" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Chat: The 35-year-old Doctor Who star said she enjoyed working on a lower-budget film rather than a Marvel blockbuster</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhqcGRufXSBjoOsppmen7Zuv9OaqWaDkaeyr3mmoqOlmZ5ir7O1zaCqZqaVrHquscCnoKefXai1sMHLnZyrZaKWsLp5zq6rn6GkY7W1ucs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-best-drake-lyrics-about-love.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The best Drake lyrics about Love</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jenny-mccarthy-playboy-playmates-then-now-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jenny McCarthy Doing Playboy 20 Years After First Spread!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
