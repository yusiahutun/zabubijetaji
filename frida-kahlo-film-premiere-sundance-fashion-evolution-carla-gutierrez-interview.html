It has all been said already, and yet, if there’s one thing to learn from Carla Gutiérrez’s new illustrated documentary film, Frida, it’s that Frida, the person, was just a normal, passionate, complex woman; and that’s the whole point.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In a film, you only have 90 minutes to tell a whole life. Our movie is really about a woman who could not contain her voice or herself, and I think that’s shown in her paintings, but also in the way that she portrayed herself to the outside world,” says Gutiérrez, a film editor whose two decades of credits include 2018’s RBG and 2021’s Julia Child documentary Julia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The film—premiering tomorrow at the annual Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah—tells Frida Kahlo’s life story through her own writings, recovered from a damp, abandoned bathroom in her and Rivera’s old home, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.museofridakahlo.org.mx/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="la Casa Azul" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>la Casa Azul</u></a>, in Mexico City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The letters and diary entries reveal the depth of Frida’s layered personalities and deeply human tendency to change herself—how she looked, what she created—in reaction to her experiences. With each stage of her life came a different era of fashion. As a young, rebellious student, she favored tailored suits and accented her masculine features, which she thought of as sexy. When she was with Diego, she became a traditional Tehuana woman, in sophisticated, colorful dresses and bright floral headpieces. And in her final years, when the pain of her ailments became too much, she wore her suffering, hand-painting her medical corsets and prosthetic legs to make them beautiful.</p><img alt="frida kahlo" title="frida kahlo" width=1612 height=2100 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1937-p0769-frida-pintando-perro-itzcuintli-conmigo-26325-amab-mstr-cc-65a6cdf1d0357.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">© Archivo Manuel Álvarez Bravo, S.C</span></p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><br></h2><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">A YOUNG REBEL<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Frida’s teenage years fell near the end of the Mexican Revolution, a period of ardent nonconformism in the country, and turmoil followed by enlightenment—her look showed that. In college, she befriended a group of rebellious young men who called themselves Los Cachuchas, or “the Guys With the Hats.” She dressed like them, in loose, tailored suits, crisp white shirts, skinny ties, buffed leather shoes, and newsboy caps. She was one of the boys—except that she was also attracted to the boys, and wanted to be them as much as she wanted to sleep with them.

These physical characteristics were not considered obviously beautiful in the 1920s, when round faces and curly flapper bobs were the ideal—but Frida was confident in her skin, and through the years, her jet-black facial hair appeared, without fail, in her self-portraits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She looked so good when she was bending gender norms; she just felt really comfortable with that,” Gutiérrez says. “She was a rebel and a badass back then, and she would have been a rebel and a badass now.”</p><img alt="frida kahlo" title="frida kahlo" width=1323 height=1889 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kbtb7m-65a6cd761bad0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Alamy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.brandeis.edu/rose/exhibitions/2021/frida-kahlo-pose.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="One famous photo" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">One famous photo</a>, taken in 1926 by Frida’s father, German-Mexican photographer Guillermo Kahlo, shows Frida wearing a full menswear look while standing with her mother, Matilde, sister Cristina, and other family members. While the women around her are in breezy flapper dresses, strands of pearls, and romantic, short hairdos, Frida is in a three-piece gray suit composed of a blazer and a fitted vest layered over a white collared shirt accented with a tie, plus slouchy high-waisted trousers and a pocket square. She has her hair in a slicked-back, side-parted bun and holds a cane, as she often did after a run-in with polio at a young age left her with one leg shorter and thinner than the other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That all changed when she met Diego Rivera.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><br></h2><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">HER LOVESTRUCK TEHUANA ERA</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Independent and strong as she was, Frida’s fashion was at its most romantic when she was with Diego—the love of her life.</p><img alt="artists diego rivera and frida kahlo visit an art gallery exhibition of jewish portraits by lionel reiss in new york" title="Artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo" width=2901 height=3734 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-517446386-65a6cb3a6708c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bettmann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because he was a communist muralist at the peak of political activism in Mexico, Diego loved showing his patriotism—and Frida loved pleasing him. So began her era of traditional Tehuana dresses. The typical dresses of the women of the isthmus of Tehuantepec, in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, are known for their intricate floral embroideries, ample layered skirts, and vibrant colors. They embody grace, elegance, and national pride.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was the bohemian, artistic, very nationalistic movement that was happening coming out of the revolution—looking at the indigenous origins with a lot of pride and wanting to claim that again.

Her nails, too, were painted in bright colors to match.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She took these traditional looks and really made them her own; she played a lot with color. And then it became more elaborate. When you see her later in life, her earrings are much bigger, the intricacies of the way that she braided her hair were more complicated,” Gutiérrez says. The filmmaker adds that while prepping to make the documentary, she spoke to Frida’s former nurse, who described helping the artist get ready in the mornings, “even if people weren’t coming to visit her. It was a whole ritual for her.”</p><img alt="frida khalo" title="frida khalo" width=1440 height=1164 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1933-p0713-frida-bitting-necklace-by-lucienne-bloch-v2-unknown-oss-multiplesources-mstr-65a6c92d31b17.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Photo by Lucienne Bloch, Courtesy Old Stage Studios</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With Diego, the woman who used to be the image of androgyny was now an ultrafeminine vision of resistance, covered in flowers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was really interesting, because she made a point to look very feminine, but also highlight her masculine aspects. She wore these traditional flowery dresses, but she also wanted to make sure that her facial hair was very present—she made a point of that,” Gutiérrez says. “I would say that she was somebody who listened to herself and was very authentic; she was just being honest to what felt good.”</p><img alt="a visitor looks at the self portrait painting by mexican artist frida kahlo during an exhibition in romes scuderie del quirinale on march 18, 2014 the scuderie del quirinale host a exhibition on the life and work of mexican artist frida kahlo 1907 1954, a symbol of the artistic avant garde and exuberance of mexican culture in the 20th century the exhibition will run from march 20 until august 31, 2014 afp photo alberto pizzoli restricted to editorial use, mandatory credit of the artist, to illustrate the event as specified in the caption photo credit should read alberto pizzoliafp via getty images" title=ITALY-EXHIBITION-FRIDA-KAHLO width=4479 height=3064 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-479361091-65a6cb192c419.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ALBERTO PIZZOLI</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And it wasn’t only Diego’s gaze she sought with her Tehuana look. Frida Kahlo was also very aware of how people in the United States (she and Diego lived in New York City for some years) saw her: as an exotic, strange, sexy being. “A lot of photographers really wanted to take her picture, and she was very aware of it. And I think she took ownership of it and used it in a way that worked for her. It was kind of like, ‘Okay, this is calling attention from people? I can have control of it.’ Kind of like an armor,” Gutiérrez says. “She was very conscious about how she presented herself, and some of it was performative, but it also really reflected very much who she was.”</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><br></h2><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">HEARTBROKEN, IN A SUIT</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Frida was bold, but it would be hyperbolic, and wrong, to say she was fearless. Like so many women long before her and long after, she was frightened of the unknown. She was hesitant to welcome a child, not knowing what it would do to her marriage. She was scared of losing her man to his own selfish desires—though, for some time, she did. As much physical pain as she felt, she was terrified of going under the knife to treat her body’s injuries. And, while she insisted she painted only what she wanted to and believed in, she was, at times, scared the buyers wouldn’t come in, or that the money wouldn’t be enough.</p>“Feminism is messy, you know?

In 1940, Diego had an affair with Frida’s most beloved sister, Cristina, and Frida divorced him. In a painting titled <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/78333 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Self-Portrait With Cropped Hair," class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Self-Portrait With Cropped Hair,</u></a> she depicted herself looking unamused, sitting on a chair in an oversize dark gray suit and maroon button-up, cutting her long, black hair. Around her, everywhere, are strands of her cropped hair, and above her, the lyrics of a song: Mira que si te quise, fué por el pelo / Ahora que estás pelona, ya no te quiero.

As a young child, she suffered from polio, a disease that left her crippled for the rest of her life. Then, at 18, she was in a terrible bus crash, which left her pelvis punctured and her back forever injured. While married to Diego, she became pregnant and suffered a miscarriage—an experience that broke her. For years, and up until the end of her life, Frida underwent difficult surgeries; at one point, she had to have her right leg amputated due to gangrene. And in her final days, she was mostly bedridden. In her writings, she spoke openly of her suffering, and as she got older, she began to wear it, hand-painting her casts and back braces, and decorating footwear for her prosthetic leg.</p>“A lot of her art was her facing pain straight on.”<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One tall, lace-up boot, on view at the Frida Kahlo Museum in Mexico City, was of bright red leather; it featured a platform heel and was adorned with a hand-painted, fantastical dragonlike creature in green and orange.
