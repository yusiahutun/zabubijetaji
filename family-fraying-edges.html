She feared his assets and empire would be taken by people other than family members,' said a source close to the family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Angela returned from the US in 2004 at the request of her mother, who hoped to protect the family's assets.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After suing Vivien, Yang filed for divorce. It came through last year and Yang reportedly walked away with as much as HK$10 billion. Meanwhile, another court case has been going on in the United States since December 2009 when Rostack Investments, a company indirectly wholly owned by Chen, commenced action in a California court against Angela for repayment of a US$30 million promissory note made in 1995.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In turn, Angela claimed that Vivien had exerted improper influence and control over Chen and that Rostack was controlled and directed by Vivien. Angela claimed that the money was linked to a ranch given to her by her father and Vivien knew about the gift. .</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen had sent Angela to the US to take care of family businesses many years previously.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She has two sons - Marcel and Damien from her first husband, Ricardo Sabella. Her second husband, Anthony Tang, lives in US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'As Chen Din-hwa had no son, Marcel and Damien were given the Chen surname,' a source said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the outcome of the court battles is unlikely to reverse Vivien's position at the Nan Fung Group because she is well entrenched, according to people familiar to the situation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She has three children from her first husband, Albert Cheung Chi-tong - Vincent, Karen and Vanessa. Vincent and Karen are now working in Nan Fung. Vivien's boyfriend, Frank Seto Kai-shui, is a director of the group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By all accounts Vivien has plenty of business acumen and is quick in making decisions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'She is a fair person and she is willing to pay commission if you clinch the deal,' said a property agent who has served Nan Fung.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But whether Vivien's dynasty can successfully carry on the Chen legacy remains to be seen, and she certainly has big shoes to fill.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born in Ningbo in 1923, Chen left school at the age of 12 to serve as an apprentice to a silk merchant. By his early 20s, he was entrusted with the management of several companies by his employer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1949, Chen left Shanghai for Hong Kong, where he hoped to establish his own business. By 1954 he had set up Nan Fung Textiles and revolutionised the industry with innovations such as the open-end spindle, earning the sobriquet 'King of Cotton Yarn'.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the boom in Hong Kong's property market, Nan Fung entered the industry in 1960s. It purchased land in Quarry Bay from the British firm John Swire and Sons and marked its first major property development, Nan Fung Sun Chuen. The firm later developed into a major developer in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen is ranked 464th on Forbes list of the world's billionaires, and 15th among the 39 billionaires from Hong Kong with a net worth of US$2.6 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen was an extraordinarily low-profile billionaire. But his low profile did not detract from his business skills with everything from nitty gritty details to grand plans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was hard working and stayed in the office very late. Before he left, he would make sure his staff turned off the lights before leaving, another former staff member recalled.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen was also described as a brilliant man. 'He was very persistent. He was not afraid of any difficulties that confronted him,' a family connection said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the smartest decisions Chen ever made was the delisting of Nan Fung.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taking into account the market crash, Chen privatised Nan Fung for just HK$1 billion in July 1989.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In anticipation of a strong luxury property market, Nan Fung acquired a number of valuable properties on The Peak for long-term investment. They included 5 Mount Austin Road, Mount Austin Estate at 8 Mount Austin Road, No 4 Peak Road and No 26 Peak Road.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'He always told us properties on The Peak should not be sold,' said a former staff member.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His vision was proven correct in the mid 1990s when despite many property developers paying record high prices to snap up sites, Chen stopped buying. He shifted his money into banking stocks in the US, where it was rumoured that at one time he owned as much as 1 per cent of Citigroup. In late 1990s he started offering real estate-backed lending, offering mortgage loans and mezzanine financing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In March 1998, Nan Fung stunned the market by announcing it had accumulated more than 10 per cent of Sino Land, boosting its stake to 13.66 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nan Fung also picked up shares in debt-ridden Lai Sun Development and financially troubled Century City International.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen was a devout Buddhist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Inspired by Buddhist teachings, he established the DH Chen Foundation in 1970, through which significant donations have been made to support worthy causes in medicine, education, welfare and the teaching of Buddhism.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Attracted by the fresh air and water, Chen frequently visited Yakushima, a small island in Japan, and Alishan in Taiwan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, the group has a staff of about 3,000 and businesses in Hong Kong, the mainland and other countries including the United States.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdhZX11gI9uZp%2BZnZ65unnFq5iyoZ6ceqawxp6q</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-blonde-hair.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Goes Blonde: The Real Reason Why</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./c3-presents-announces-noah-kahan-and-foo-fighters-for-connecticuts-soundside-music-festival.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>C3 Presents Announces Noah Kahan And Foo Fighters For Connecticuts Soundside Music Festival</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
