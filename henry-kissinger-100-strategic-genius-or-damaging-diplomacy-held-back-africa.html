As Peter Vale, a historian at the University of Pretoria, wrote in <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">a recent essay for the Conversation</a>, where he described Kissinger’s record in Africa as “dismal” and said he “neither ended colonialism nor minority rule in the region”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>He wrote: “Kissinger’s interest in southern Africa in the mid-1970s was predicated on the idea that balance would return if the interests of the strong were restored. He failed to understand that the struggle for justice was changing the world – and diplomacy itself.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Speaking to the Guardian, Vale described the meeting at the Hotel Bodenmais and what it portended. “The conference was a bunch of white men sitting in Germany.

It was felt important for white South Africa to stay stable because of trade and minerals.
