I went to Ramaz School, in Manhattan. I’d stay around in the city as long as I dared and come home late. There was stuff going on in the city, and the suburbs were deadly to someone who is interested in things. Every night it felt like leaving paradise to go into exile.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The Hong Kong Bach Choir at 50: from division to diversity</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The teachers who liked me thought I was rebellious. The English teacher who I was close to thought I was like James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause, which wasn’t true at all. I was simply completely undisciplined, I hadn’t learned how to focus yet. Schoolwork came easy enough that I could get by without doing a lot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My school music teacher put me in touch with her friend, Bruce Saylor, who was on his way to becoming a prominent composer. I studied with him in my last year in high school, and he advised me about universities.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Good conductor</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I studied music at Brandeis University, a liberal arts school outside Boston. I joined the student shows and it quickly became apparent that the musical leadership wasn’t very good, and people started relying on me. Before my second year, I proposed that I conduct the next year’s student-run show.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I talked my way into that, and it went well – it was something that came naturally to me. When you are a beginner you don’t know enough to be scared.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong drag queen Coco Pop on climbing the cross-dressing ladder</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After my second year, I spent the summer in Israel, where my brother was working on his dissertation. The Rubin Academy of Music, in Jerusalem, was running a summer course with Igor Markevitch, a famous conductor of the old school. As someone from the States with some experience, they didn’t even make me audition, and immediately put me in the group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I got a lot of encouragement from the players in the orchestra and it went well. This is a field in which you keep going until someone says no – and no one said no. I had various successes early on – before I knew anything – and that puts the pressure on because you are identified as someone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I felt the pressure, it made it harder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/f083c97a-a004-4831-a044-d2cbba0c40d1_75d3b696.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Knowing the score</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I graduated in 1978 and for a year rented an apartment in the north end of Boston, where all the Mafiosi families lived, so it was very safe. I got a couple of part-time teaching jobs to pay the rent and spent the year practising and studying scores and then I applied for a master’s degree at the University of Wisconsin, where Catherine Comet, a French woman who had been a conductor of the Paris Opéra Ballet, took me on. She was a natural, so she didn’t know how to teach, but I got a lot of experience and she was a good mentor.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From there I went to the Peabody Conservatory of the Johns Hopkins University to do a doctoral thesis in conducting. In 1982, I married Rhondda May, an oboist I’d met in Wisconsin. My teacher and the department secretary conspired to get us together, they thought we’d make a good couple.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rhondda got jobs in various orchestras and I did some guest conducting. We moved to Baltimore and then to Pennsylvania, to Kansas and then she decided to go back to school and we went to Cincinnati and along the way I was going back to where we had been previously to conduct.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/6daa4cc3-07ee-4050-8c88-69b661e95ed6_3bb33c2e.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Building a repertoire</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rhondda was hired to play in the Hong Kong Philharmonic, and we arrived in Hong Kong in 1991. I began sending off my CV and Hong Kong Baptist College offered me a part-time job. They wanted to restart their orchestra and were running a bridging programme to convert diplomas into degrees. Within a year it became a permanent position and I ended up working there for nine years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In my second year at Baptist, a colleague, Michael Ryan, who had previously conducted the Hong Kong Bach Choir, told me they were looking for a new conductor and asked if I might be interested. It had been founded in 1970 and was run on a British choral society model, which is very amateur, people aren’t paid.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I made it a condition of my coming that I be paid. It was a token amount, but I wanted to make it a more serious group, with serious aspirations and a more ambitious repertoire. I also sought to make it less of an expat group and more of a universal group that included locals. In 1997, the choir was invited to participate in the British farewell ceremony at Tamar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/1b1ed6ce-1ef4-4677-824f-8e25830aa83b_b01604d4.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Not for profit</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After my time at Baptist, I spent a couple of years as head of artists and repertoire at Naxos Records. I learned what people do when they work in offices and also learned that I had no talent for business; I had no appreciation of the profit motive. I went back to teaching and writing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All through my time in Hong Kong, I’ve done various things at RTHK Radio 4, from presenting classical radio shows to doing CD reviews. I had two children with Rhondda – they are now 26 and 28 – and she moved back to the US in 2006, where my daughters went to university. I met my current partner, Grace, when she auditioned with the choir.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Within a week of her audition, my rehearsal pianist had a schedule change and I needed a pianist and Grace stepped in. She has been a serious pianist and won national competitions in Canada as a kid. She went back to Hawaii to finish her dissertation and returned to Hong Kong to take a post with Lingnan University.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She contacted me and we ended up going out for dinner and have been together ever since. She’s still at Lingnan and I teach a class there now and then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/03/eb4922c4-2b95-4b64-8671-0102acff53b9_fd1af8c4.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Hitting the high notes</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The choir is now more than 50 years old – the 50th anniversary concert on December 7 is a little delayed because of Covid-19 – so I’ve been with it for more than half its life. We first did Bach’s Mass in B Minor for the choir’s 25th anniversary, in 1995. That was my first time doing the piece and I was terrified. It’s a mammoth, gigantic, overwhelming masterpiece and it’s very presumptuous for any musician to say he or she is up to performing this piece, but by now it’s probably the piece I’ve done more than any other so I have an idea of how it should go.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My goal is to keep making better and better music. Conductors are fortunate in the sense that the age that a lot of people retire is when we’re thought of as just getting good. I hope I’m healthy long enough to be able to profit from all the training. Now I feel like maybe I’m finally getting the idea and next time can actually get it right.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I’m fortunate that the choir is coming along with me and continues to improve and that the best orchestral players in Hong Kong are still willing to play for me. I try to do music that will interest them, too. I just want to keep doing more of this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtq12iwrS1wmiYq6yZmLmme5JqbHFqZ2x8tLXNoKCnn12otq67zWaYp5xdnK6zstSnop6kXZi8t7HRrGSsm5ikvK15wa6qZmpp</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gpt-3-5-vs-gpt-4.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>GPT 3.5 vs. GPT 4: What's the Difference?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./66113601ca474137068b4598-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Atletismo: Las Binter Night Run Series despegan hoy en Tenerife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
