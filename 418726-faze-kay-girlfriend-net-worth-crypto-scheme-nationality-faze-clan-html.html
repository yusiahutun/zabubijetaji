Many of his followers are frequently asking, ''What is FaZe Kay's real name?'' The internet sensation was born Frazier Kay and has mixed ethnicity from his British mother and Nepali father. FaZe's mother, Barbara Khattri, is a <a href=#>business</a> consultant, but his father's life details have remained mysterious.</p><p class=align-left>Kay was a brilliant student who <a id=https://socialstarswiki.com/faze-kay/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">studied</a> at Oxted School in England. He took up Business Studies but got interested in gaming and software development while he was studying. Therefore, he dropped Business Studies and took a different program. However, FaZe also ditched the course to become an online <a href=#>celebrity</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The British gamer has three siblings, namely, FaZe Jarvis, Jay Kay, Chandler Kay.
