Source: Instagram</p><h4>Selena Quintanilla</h4><p>His third child Selena was born on April 16, 1971, at the Freeport Community Hospital. Selena had a gift for music and her father recognized it at a very young age. He decided to fulfill his dreams through his children.</p><p>Without wasting any more time he engaged her in training her vocals. He formed a band taking reference from his prior band and named it Selena y Los Dinos which translates to Selena and The Guys.</p><p>He even opened a restaurant named PapaGayos so that Selena could perform in front of people. However, due to the after-effects of World War II, the place was shut down. After being evicted from their own homes, he still hadn’t given up on his dreams.</p><p>He along with his daughter performed in different social gatherings like weddings, parties, and many other social events. After going through many obstacles in life, Selena was finally signed by Freddie Records in the year 1984.</p><p>However, soon after the release of her first record, she was moved to Cara Records by her father. With time Selena’s career grew and she along with her bands reached new heights. Selena has won a Grammy in the past for her album “Best Mexican-American Album”.</p><p>However, happiness didn’t last long for Selena and her family. On March 31, 1995, Selena was brutally murdered by a woman named Yolanda Saldivar. Yolanda was the president of the Selena fan club and manager of Selena boutiques.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Life>Professional Life</span></h2><p>Abraham Quintanilla Jr.&nbsp; first gave wings to his dream of becoming a professional singer in the year 1957, when he heard his alumni classmates performing. Just then, he happened to know that one of the band members was quitting the group and was lacking a vocalist.</p><p>That is when he shot his shot and approached the band. The band was called ” Los Dinos”. The band released its first song in the year 1959. The title of the song was “So Hard To Tell”, and the song instantly became popular at a radio station in Abraham’s hometown.</p><p>Similar to their first song, their song single was also a hit and received ample airplay in South Texas. After this particular song, their popularity as a musical band grew further.</p><p>However, it wasn’t always happy day for the Los Dinos. The band faced extreme racial discrimination and hatred from people as they belonged to Mexican descent. Their shows were canceled just cause they were Mexican Americans.</p><p>Likewise, they were denied various accommodations while they traveled out of their town to perform. Unlike their previous songs, their third and fourth songs didn’t do quite well.</p><p>The band didn’t release new music for quite a while as he was drafted into military service in the year 1961 and discharged in 1963. After he rejoined the band, they began to explore new forms of music like American pop, and Rock and Roll.</p><h4>More about Los Dino’s</h4><p>One evening when the band was performing for a Mexican crowd, the audience demanded them to sing Spanish- Mexican songs. Unfortunately, the band didn’t know how any Mexican music and had to face humiliation after the angry crowd hissed at them.</p><p>Due to various reasons, the band changed their genre to Chicano Rocks and recorded their first record in the new genre in the year 1964. Their new song Con Esta Copa which translates to With This Cup was one of the band’s most popular songs ever put out.</p><p>However, with time and new bands with greater potential emerging, Los Dino’s popularity was fading away. He decided to leave the band as he had to support his family. The band carried on without him for a few years but later officially disbanded.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-105434 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Abraham-Quintanilla-Jr.-career.jpg alt="Abraham Quintanilla Jr." width=650 height=895 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-105434 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Abraham Quintanilla Jr. and his daughter Selena were photographed together.
