The employee did not call the New York City police.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The mother did not call the police either. Instead, she called her brother, Mr James Chang, at his home in Queens, who, with three friends, jumped into his car and drove to his sister's home, a condominium development protected by guards stationed at theentrance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Chang told eight other members of the family in the house to go to the second floor when the van with the three gunmen pulled into the garage. The kidnappers, who used Mr Tung and his brother to get them past the security guard, were unaware 11 peoplewere waiting inside, said assistant chief of the Nassau County Police, Mr Mel Kenny.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As they entered the house, they were met by Mr Chang, who surprised and quickly disarmed one of the kidnappers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Using the kidnapper's gun, Mr Chang fired several shots at the kidnapper and used it to subdue the two others while his friends tied their hands, Mr Kenny said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mrs Tung called for help after hearing the gunshots.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since all the victims and the suspects spoke Chinese, Mr Kenny said that when police arrived they had to wait for a translator to determine what had happened.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The wounded kidnapper died shortly after arriving at a nearby hospital. Police said they were trying to identify him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The two suspects arraigned were identified in court as Qiao Zheng, 17, of Manhattan, and Jian R. Chen, 21, also of Manhattan. They were being held without bail in Nassau County Jail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Kenny said the police were seeking a possible fourth suspect.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the abduction of the two brothers was apparently the first step in a plan to rob the Tung home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Kenny said Nassau County police had investigated several robberies at Asian homes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">''The victims usually own or operate cash-related businesses and the basic mode of operation has been the same. Armed men force their way into the home or use some other deceptive tactic to get in, then take what money they can.'' He said neither the Tungs nor Mr Chang, whom he described as a hero, knew the kidnappers. No charges were filed against Mr Chang, he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdhbIN1gI6voJysmaLAbsDUq6VmrJGXuaa%2FjJyfoqaRqby4uoykoJ2mkaW9pr7S</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mothers-day-gifts-under-500-dollars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Mother's Day Gifts Under $500 for the Stylish Mom</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dangers-of-diy-teeth-whitening.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The dangers of DIY teeth whitening</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
