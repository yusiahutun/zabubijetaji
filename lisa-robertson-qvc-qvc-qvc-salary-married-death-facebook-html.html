Lisa served for QVC for a long 20 years, beginning from the year 1995 and ending on December 12, 2014. For the service&nbsp;she provided the network, she was paid an annual <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">salary</a> of $ 1 million, which in return contributed to her budding net worth of $ 5 million. Well, it wasn't just the monetary benefits she got from the show, as Lisa garnered a huge fan base while working for QVC.</p><p>After nearly two years from departure, YouTube still has a thousand views on the host's videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>However, as it is believed that everything has its pros and cons, so did Lisa's popularity!&nbsp;Her fame came with a downside, for over the years, Lisa was forced to deal with four different stalkers&nbsp;who turned up at Lisa's home, tailed her, and approached other TV presenters seeking to meet Lisa.</p><p>There were quite a lot of instances where Lisa was extremely frightened by the stalkers; People would try to draw her family in and even try to contact them. This wasn't very cool for the host.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The stalkers made Lisa seek legal protection, and she begged for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">help</a>&nbsp;from a judge, saying,</p><p>'I need to be able to live without being afraid.'</p><p>The stalker's issue got to the point that Lisa left QVC, admitting that the incident factored her decision of leaving the network. Moreover, she wanted to achieve more in her life than just spending 20 hours doing the same regular work for 20 years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She even said that if she were to continue the same work, she would love it, but there was nothing left to do there: She wanted to explore a new field completely different from this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>What Does Lisa Robertson Do Now?</h2><p>Lisa, who believes to have never been a risk-taker, challenged herself and took the risk of trying a new career, which turned out to be beneficial.</p><p>She launched a website named Lisarobertson.com, where she sells her own jewelry line and shares her passion for fashion, exercises, travel, and advice. She has even set up a shop where a handful of employees work.&nbsp;</p><p>She is in close contact with her fans via Facebook's live chat.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><h2>Is Lisa Robertson Married?</h2><p>Parting from the show helped Lisa's fans learn about her love life, as Lisa then came forth addressing&nbsp;her relationship with&nbsp;Eric McGee.&nbsp;Eric, a personal trainer by profession, is a previously married man and has two children with ex-wife, Amy.</p><p></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Lisa with her Boyfriend, Eric McGee, who is 11 years junior to her&nbsp;</strong>(Photo Credit: Dailymail)</p><p>The duo looked all smitten in one another's company. Lisa&nbsp;had quality time with her boyfriend, going on vacations.</p><h2>QVC Host Lisa Robertson Death Speculation</h2><p>After a year or so of dating, in 2016,&nbsp;the death speculation of Lisa started swirling around with no evidence to support the grounds. People began forming theories that Lisa passed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">away</a>; but, she was, and is, doing&nbsp;fine.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She is living the best of life with a prosperous career and a supportive partner by her side. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqWho5Z6s7vBnqmtq5%2BjerLCwmaor5tdpsOkedKao5qqqWK6or7RopydZZSarrW0jJ%2BYnJ2SpLysesetpKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-sergeant-strictly-wife-tv-shows-presented.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How old is John Sergeant, when was he on Strictly Come Dancing, who's his wife and what TV shows has</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maren-morris-the-bones-austin-city-limits-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Maren Morris Perform 'The Bones' Ahead of 'ACL' Debut</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
