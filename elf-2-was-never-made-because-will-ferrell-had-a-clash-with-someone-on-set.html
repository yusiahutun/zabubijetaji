The 56-year-old <a href=#>movie</a> star has snagged four Emmy Awards for his masterclass performances across the years. In 2011, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> was also honored with the&nbsp;Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Ferrell’s reputation with comedy films led him to an exciting offer of Elf 2 with a huge paycheck, but something did not work out. We’re pretty bummed it didn’t.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1838591414-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-ferrell-s-co-star-james-caan-revealed-why-elf-2-never-happened>Will Ferrell’s co-star James Caan revealed why Elf 2 never happened</h2><p>Will Ferrell reportedly had no other choice but to turn down a large paycheck of $29 million for Elf 2. While many speculated what could possibly be the reason, his co-star James Caan revealed what went on behind the scenes before his death. The film was about to be made but due to some ‘tension’ among the creators, it was ultimately canceled.</p><p>Caan quipped to a radio show: “We were gonna do it and I thought, ‘Oh my god, I finally got a franchise movie, I could make some money, let my kids do what the hell they want to do.”</p><p>While things were about to be set in motion, he revealed Will’s clear clash with the director became a crucial factor.</p><p>“But the director and Will didn’t get along very well. So, Will wanted to do it, he didn’t want the director, and he had it in his contract, it was one of those things…,” Caan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> on Cleveland’s 92.3 The Fan’s Bull & Fox.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-182340752-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-ferrell-couldn-t-be-honest-about-the-movie>Will Ferrell couldn’t be ‘honest’ about the movie</h2><p>A rather candid Will Ferrell once shared what stopped him from going ahead with Elf’s sequel as well. The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> icon admitted, even for the first film, he felt apprehension it “could be the end” of his career.</p><p>While the first flick went ahead and did massively well, the actor felt he could not be honest about the second one even if he ever did it.</p><p>“I&nbsp;would have had to promote the movie from&nbsp;an honest place, which would’ve been, like, ‘Oh&nbsp;no, it’s not good. I just couldn’t turn down that much money,'” Ferrell <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confessed</a>.</p><p>“And I thought, ‘Can I actually say those words? I don’t think I can, so I guess I can’t do the movie.'”</p><p>While the sequel never came to production, Ferrell had a chance to reunite with his co-stars Zooey Deschanel, Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Andy Richer, Amy Sedaris, Mary Steenburgen, Matt Walsh and Kyle Glass a decade later. In December 2020, the cast of the flick met for a virtual charity read in support of&nbsp;the Democratic Party of Georgia.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eDcLHLn2RrZaeWwG66xK%2Bcq2WdlrGmecGempqto5p6uLXLpWSfnaKnsq24jKGYnWWRYrCtrdKhZLChpJ16tLvMnqannV2ku26%2FxK1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-winston-george-bio-wiki-age-height-net-worth-salary-married-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Winston George Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Salary, Married, Wife</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./survivor-season-32-winner-one-most-controversial-sole-survivors-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why the 'Survivor' Season 32 Winner Is One of the Most Controversial Sole Survivors</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
