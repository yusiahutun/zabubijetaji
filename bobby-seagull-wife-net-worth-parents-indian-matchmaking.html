He loves solving complex equations. However, when it came to the equations of love, he fell behind! Thus, in search of a partner, he sought help from the matchmaking guru Sima Taparia, and his romantic adventure was featured on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Indian Matchmaking</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 3.</span></p><p>Keep reading to learn more.</p><h3><b>Did Bobby Seagull Find A Wife On Netflix’s Indian Matchmaking?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Bobby Seagull came out of the show single! It seems he and Priya Ashr just couldn’t find that spark even though their families were already getting together. Infact, Bobby and Priya’s parents were right there when they met for the first time alongside their matchmaker Sima Taparia — it was literally a get-together!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>No wonder, they started off surprisingly strong with the help of small talk as well as their common ground of being optimistic, curious, family-oriented individuals. Later, the duo also attended a salsa class Bobby arranged for them to break the ice.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yet Priya simply could not feel the chemistry with him. She appreciated who he was and what he stood for but it’s just that she also quickly knew something was missing. Hence, she, unfortunately, ended up openly friend-zoning him.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“I think I’m single because… not because I’m fussy or picky. It’s just like sometimes I have not met the right person at the right time. So I’m waiting; I’m a husband-in-waiting,” Bobby said before meeting Priya.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Guess, he’s still a “husband-in-waiting.” But we’re sure Bobby will soon find someone as “enthusiastic and positive” as him who won’t mind him being “too positive, overactive, and energetic.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bobby recently spent Valentine’s Day 2023 with an early morning spin class and a visit to his library.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Priya, she went on to make a connection with Vim and even went as far as to invite him to meet her only sister and her closest friends during a get-together where she was the host. Sadly, things didn’t work out between them as well.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Bobby Seagull Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bobby Seagull flaunted a net worth of above $1.5 million in 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This school maths teacher started his career as an investment banking trader at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Lehman Brothers</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Nomura</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2006. He was then qualified to become the&nbsp; Chartered Accountant of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>PricewaterhouseCoopers</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> — where he worked for 3 ½ years. So, it was at PWC, he had this epiphany that he loved teaching!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thus, Bobby went to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Cambridge University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> to do his PGCE Maths course, and he started his first job as a maths teacher at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>East London Science School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2015. Then, he joined </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Chesterton Community Sports College</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Little Ilford School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (where he was teaching at the time of writing this article.)</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Alongside teaching, Bobby also has been writing books. So far, he published two books titled </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Monkman & Seagull Quiz</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Life-Changing Magic of Numbers</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thanks to his mathematic skills, Bobby has also been invited as a quizzer, a host, or even a contestant for shows such as </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Pilgrimage</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2023), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Weakest Link</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2023), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The One Show</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2018 – 2023), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Countdown</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2022), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Would I Like to You</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (2022), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Answer Trap </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>(2021), and many more.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for his education, he’s studied at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Cambridge University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>; </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Royal Holloway, University of London</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>; </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>University of Oxford</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>; </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Eton College</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>; and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>St Bonaventure’s Catholic Comprehensive Secondary</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Bobby Seagull Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bobby Seagull was 39 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Indian Matchmaking</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He is 4 years older than Priya.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Bobby Seagull Parents?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Bobby Seagull’s parents are originally from Kerala, India. They came to the UK in the 70s before Bobby was born. After arriving in Britain, his father Jose Seagull worked as an accountant while his mother raised the boys.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It was also after coming to the UK, Bobby’s father gave him and his brother Tommy&nbsp; “Seagull” as a surname, inspired by Richard Bach’s 1970 novella Jonathan Livingston Seagull, about a bird who tried to find a higher meaning in life through perfecting flight.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“My father wanted his children to have the same drive to be the best they can and inspire others, too,” he explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Bobby’s mother beat Jonathan to the register office when the other two of Bobby’s siblings were born. Thus, they have different surnames — Bobby Seagull, Tommy Seagull, Davey Jose, and John Jose.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But though different surnames, they all share Jay as a first name.&nbsp; “It’s a south Indian tradition of sorts to share the same first name and to be known by your middle name. My parents came to the UK from Kerala in India which has historic links with Portugal. That’s why my dad’s surname is Jose. He’s an entrepreneur at heart who’s full of ideas and always starting new projects. He made us believe we could do anything,” Bobby explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking a little about his brother, Davey, he had sustained spinal injuries when he was run over as a toddler. So, now, as an artist, he explores spinal injury in his works at</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Tate Modern</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, for Tate Lates.
