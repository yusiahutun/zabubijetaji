The same week, the creators of the Apple TV+ animated series Central Park announced that <a href=#>Kristen Bell</a> would no longer voice a biracial character named Molly, and will be replaced by <a href=#>The Umbrella Academy star Emmy Raver-Lampman</a> for the show’s second season.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616edg00163g63b2yux6ld@published data-word-count=108>As the Black Lives Matter movement has reignited this summer, prompting vows from almost every major U.S. institution to confront their racist cultures and practices, the voice-over industry has been no exception. The sudden rise of calls for <a href=#>color-conscious casting</a> comes after years of criticism about whitewashed roles. But while many Black voice actors are glad to see white actors leaving roles where they played characters of color&nbsp;—&nbsp;a trend that also includes The Simpsons star Hank Azaria, who voiced the Indian convenience store clerk Apu up until February, when he claimed that it just “<a href=#>didn’t feel right</a>” —&nbsp;they believe more meaningful changes are needed for truly equitable hiring.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616ehm00173g63i4l9z0xw@published data-word-count=87>“The fact that this conversation is now front and center, after decades of being bypassed, shows that something transformative is happening,” said Joan Baker, a Black voice actor who is the co-founder of the<a href=#> Society of Voice Arts and Sciences</a>. “We must insist that casting directors, talent agents, and talent managers who are the primary gatekeepers for major voice-over jobs be enlightened to the reality that they are complicit in racial inequality if they don’t do the work of matching actors of color with characters of color.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616eiz00183g63xpzjd0uj@published data-word-count=129>Whitewashing within the voice-over industry has <a href=#>existed for decades</a>, and white men have historically filled most roles in<strong> </strong>casting, drawing, animating, writing, and voicing characters. Baker, the author of Secrets of Voice-Over Success, co-founded the SOVAS to counter those trends. Since 2013, the nonprofit offers education, professional training, and job opportunities for voice actors. But Baker still thinks a lot needs to change in the voice-acting world. While most jobs are governed by predetermined union rates (and nonunion jobs often follow the same parameters), she says that Black voice actors simply aren’t getting enough job opportunities. “The real question, as it relates to Black voice actors versus white voice actors, is who gets hired,” Baker says. “Black actors are still working overtime to get equal representation and critical acclaim.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616enq00193g63a3fmymts@published data-word-count=66>Neither the SAG-AFTRA union (which represents TV and film actors) nor the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative (which tracks Hollywood diversity) tracks statistics on diversity within the voice-actor industry. Still, Baker says, the inequity is obvious: “Blacks lag behind, as they do in almost every other segment of employment. In America, the number of Black voice actors is still not representative of the population.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dfb/e8a/fdb0e8c36ddc2824d23fe5286659977730-lenny-fanboy-chum-chum.rhorizontal.w700.jpg> Wyatt Cenac as Lenny Flynn-Boyle in Fanboy & Chum Chum.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616ez5001b3g63wpiqjpl8@published data-word-count=82>Wyatt Cenac, a comedian and former Daily Show correspondent, voices two characters on Nickelodeon’s Fanboy & Chum Chum. A fair industry, he says, is one where Black voices are not just in the recording booth, but hired on all levels as writers, directors, and animators. “We’re still in a time where TV networks have no hesitation making four animated shows about white families,” he says, “but if they had two great scripts starring Black families, they’d feel like they have to choose.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616f83001c3g63flb8p9d3@published data-word-count=46>“It feels like the problem has grown in part because there has been an emphasis on casting big names over the right names,” Cenac continues. “When we talk about systemic racism, when every top-level person is white, chances are that top-level talent is overwhelmingly white, too.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616fat001d3g6356cuxkzp@published data-word-count=84>Venus Crute, who has been working in the voice-over industry for more than 15 years, including for shows produced by<strong> </strong>Disney and CBS, says that it’s admirable white actors are voluntarily stepping down to make room for Black actors. But she, too, agrees that it is not enough. “If the producers, directors, and network executives don’t adopt fair casting practices and cast actors who are the right fit for the role in all regards, then these gestures will not make any difference,” Crute says.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616fcc001e3g63ovb16f78@published data-word-count=97>Recently, Hollywood casting agents have begun tapping into<a href=#> the African American Voice Actor Database</a> to find Black voice actors.<strong> </strong>The database features over 170 members and offers free membership to any Black voice actors who are over the age of 18 and have a professionally produced audio demo reel.<strong> </strong>Bryan Howard, the founder of the database, says that several streaming companies have written to him in search of more Black voice actors for their shows. “The ultimate solution is to get more African-Americans and people of color into casting, the production side, to create opportunities,” he says.</p><span class=caption>Make It Soul trailer.</span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616fdv001f3g63m8d2ks8c@published data-word-count=111>Those kinds of opportunities can have profound effects on a project. While working on the 2018 indie animated short Make It Soul, the Paris-based voice actor Avant Strangel was able to change a casting director’s mind after he saw that a white co-star couldn’t nail the voice of James Brown (the director then found another actor for the role). He also offered recommendations to a few talents in his professional<strong> </strong>network for a pair of other roles, which ended up working out (“There is a small network of Black expats I knew, so I put out the word,” he adds). Make It Soul wound up getting nominated for a César Award.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616fgo001g3g63s9cmbg0s@published data-word-count=53>“In this case, it was really more of a ‘they didn’t know where to look,’” Strangel recalls. “It’s simple: Hire the appropriate person of color for the roles. Anything less is just an aural and oral blackface. And any white person telling someone to ‘sound more Black’ deserves a punch in the throat.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckd616fid001h3g637gdcuwn6@published data-word-count=83>Changing the voice-acting industry won’t just come down to casting alone. Baker, for one, wants to see more Black creatives get the opportunities to create their own TV shows and projects, so they can call the shots of how to cast each role. “The all-white ensemble that plays the roles of people of color, whether those roles are principles or incidental, is a gross and immoral situation,” she says. “It must be called out from the backroom studios and it must be stopped.”</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckbv4i6nb00008uopa7w22fgr@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Fixing Your Color-blind Casting Problem Is Actually Very Easy</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckd0op2zu00000rn4863cv8rw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Central Park Casts Emmy Raver-Lampman As Kristen Bell’s Replacement</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckbwuuqcm00008an5tjpu0hz6@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Simpsons Also Steps Away From White Actors Voicing Characters of Color</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>What Black Voice Actors Want Hollywood to Do Next</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyjuMCcomaun56wpnnAnKuoqqNitbC4y7KuqKeUYsG3edahoK2dp5bAqbXNoGWhrJ2h</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bae-suzy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bae Suzy - Age, Bio, Birthday, Family, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-the-worlds-chicest-cult.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Spirit Weavers Gathering All-Women's New Age Celebration</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
