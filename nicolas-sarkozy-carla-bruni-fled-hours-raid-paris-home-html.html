Sarkozy knew police would come ‘looking’ for him, close friends of the ex-president have claimed.</span></p><p><span>As the former French leader and his wife Carla Bruni sought refuge in the home of a Canadian billionaire, it has emerged that the pair fled just hours before his Paris home and office was raided by anti-corruption police.</span></p><p><span>Although the former president has made no public comment, friends of his were quoted in Le Parisien newspaper as saying: “I know they’ll come looking for me. Nothing will come of it all.”</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/04/article-2168702-13D43CA0000005DC-836_468x445.jpg height=445 width=468 alt="The couple pictured after meeting Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, only a few days before they took off to Canada" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The couple pictured after meeting Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, only a few days before they took off to Canada</p><p><span>Mr Sarkozy is currently seeking refuge in the Montreal home of 86-year-old Canadian businessman Paul Desmarais.</span></p><p><span>That is sure to raise eyebrows in France as well because Sarkozy awarded the Legion of Honour, France’s highest civilian award, in 2008.</span></p><p><span>His Paris residence was raided amid allegations that the ex-President accepted thousands of pounds in cash from France’s richest woman.</span></p><p><span>Liliane Bettencourt, the L’Oreal cosmetics heiress, is said to have provided the money in brown envelopes to fund Sarkozy’s political career in return for future tax breaks.</span></p><p><span>Sarkozy’s immunity from prosecution ended last month after he lost his re-election bid, and on Tuesday detectives launched dawn swoops on three addresses connected with him.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/04/article-2168702-0E5861E600000578-983_468x458.jpg height=458 width=468 alt="Heiress: Liliane Bettencourt is the richest woman in Europe.

During his presidency, Sarkozy was frequently accused of solely being interested in the super-rich.</span></p><p><span>He infamously celebrated his presidential victory in 2007 with a number of multi-billionaire friends in Fouquet’s, an upmarket Paris restaurant. Desmarais was on the guest list.</span></p><p><span>Judge Jean-Michel Gentil believes that Mrs Bettencourt may have illegally contributed two separate payments of £335,000 to Mr Sarkozy’s 2007 election campaign. Both were traced to Swiss accounts, and one was allegedly received by Sarkozy in person in Paris.</span></p><p><span>Sarkozy is also facing allegations that he profited from illegal arms sales to Pakistan, and that he accepted millions from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy denies all the charges, with his lawyer Thierry Herzog saying the searches of his home and two lawyers offices linked to him would ‘find nothing’.</span></p><p><span>Mr Herzog claimed that the Sarkozy family was merely ‘on holiday’ in Canada, and would return to France in around two weeks.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FcoKXcGdrZ36esLC4wKxkjJmioLy7xYx8mKukkWKPs8HNomSfpJWZeqm71KuqZqqRnrFunMCroKxlmKS6pnrHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./songwriter-kim-williams-dead.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Respected Nashville Songwriter Kim Williams Dead at 68</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rosamund-pike-reveals-face-injury-reason-for-shielded-lace-look-golden-globes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Saltburn's Rosamund Pike hid facial injury from ski accident at Golden Globes see photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
