In addition, he has worked with prominent artists like Rick Ross, B.o.B, Wale, Meek Mill, Lil Scrappy, and MGK, amongst others.&nbsp;</p><p>Southside and Yung Miami started dating in 2018. Even though they had an on-again-off-again relationship for two years, they welcomed their daughter, Summer Miami Luellen, a year into the relationship.</p><p>Although fans thought having a child together in 2019 would solidify their relationship, the couple called it quits in 2020. Southside and Yung Miami may no longer be an item, but the former couple remain amicable co-parents for their daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-19_05-20-11-fotor-2023071952627.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Siblings_Does_Summer_Miami_Luellen_Have></span>How Many Siblings Does Summer Miami Luellen Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yung Miami’s daughter, Summer Miami Luellen, has six siblings.
