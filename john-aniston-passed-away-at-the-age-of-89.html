Jennifer Aniston, his daughter, and actress uploaded a couple of photos of him on social media with the caption:</p><p>“Papa, sweet papa… Aniston, John Anthony You were one of the most attractive people I had ever met. I’m so glad you soared into the sky in peace – and without agony. And on November 11th, no less! You had impeccable timing. That number will always have a special importance to me. I’ll cherish you till the end of time. Don’t forget to stop by.”</p><p>The reason for his death is unclear, and information regarding his funeral will be disclosed shortly.</p><h2>John Aniston’s wife&nbsp;Sherry Rooney</h2><p>In 1984, John Aniston married Sherry Rooney. Sherry is a well-known actress who has acted in films such as Search for Tomorrow, Love of Life, Who Is Harry Kellerman, and Why Is He Saying Such Bad Things About Me? On the set of Love of Life, the two initially met.&nbsp;Despite considerable conjecture, John and Sherry refused to talk about their relationship for many years. Nancy Dow was John’s former wife. In 1965, John and Nancy married. In 1980, they decided to divorce.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/John-Aniston-1.jpg alt="John Aniston" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jennifer from his first marriage to Nancy and Alexander from his second marriage to Sherry Aniston has two children. He was also the stepfather to Nancy’s previous marriage’s son, John T. Melick.&nbsp;Jennifer Aniston previously remarked that her family suffered as a consequence of John and Nancy’s divorce and that she had to spend a long time apart from her mother after her divorce. In an interview with Allure, she stated:</p><p>“My mother’s divorce, I believe, ruined her. It wasn’t like, ‘Go to counseling, speak to someone,’ back then. ‘How about you start microdosing?’ You’re going through life, scooping up your kid with tears on your cheeks, and you have no one to assist you.”</p><h2>John Aniston was well-known for his role in Days of Our Lives.</h2><p>John Aniston graduated with a bachelor’s degree in theatrical arts from Pennsylvania State University, where he was also a member of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity, on July 24, 1993.&nbsp;Following graduation, he joined the US Navy as an intelligence officer, first on active service in Panama and later in the reserves, eventually attaining the rank of lieutenant commander. He made his acting debut in 1962 on 87th Precinct and afterward appeared on Days of Our Lives, Love of Life, Search for Tomorrow, and other series.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/John-Aniston-2.jpg alt="John Aniston" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He was featured in programs such as Gilmore Girls, The West Wing, Debate Camp, and others, and had small parts in the second season of the military drama series Airwolf.
