I really am proud of it. The day we actually picked up the lorry we were both just sat in the truck in disbelief like ‘oh my god this is ours’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31284669.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_I-am-a-nurse-who-started-swinging-and-making-sex-tapes-but-hospital-porters-found-out.jpg><p>They spent £40,000 on the truck and Ben said you also need up to £60,000 in a bank account to start your own haulage company successfully.</p><p>And having the funds to go their own path was down to the saucy content the pair, who met via Tinder eight years ago, made together online.</p><p>Nicolle, who joined the Army at 16 and served seven years, said: “It [OnlyFans] has only got better, it is still on the up and we are still working hard at it. We are shocked everyday.</p><p>"You get days where it is up, days where it is down, so it is just always a shock to us, it is a kind of disbelief and we sit back and think ‘we are actually doing this’.</p><p>“Obviously the OnlyFans side of things, I don’t want to be doing that forever. So we look at that as having an expiry date. And we don’t want to be in a position where I want to stop doing OnlyFans and then end up in full-time work for somebody else. So we thought it was probably best to set up our own company.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>They have been vlogging about lorries and what’s involved behind the scenes with starting their own firm on the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Trucker Baddie YouTube channel</a> where they have 10,000 subscribers.</p><p>And having the time to make videos was something not possible just two years ago when the pair barely saw each other – because they worked 15 hour days.</p><p>Reflecting on how much has changed so quickly, Ben, 33, told us: “I am mega proud. I try and keep myself grounded and remind myself that it was only a year and a half, two years ago when I was working flat out for somebody else and to be fair I am working flat out now but it is for myself.</p><p>“It is different when you do it for yourself because if I wanna go gym, I will just go gym. It is nice, you have to be disciplined though because if you don't keep on top of things, things don’t happen.”</p><p>Ben added: “But this definitely wouldn’t have been possible without OnlyFans. I have always looked at people who have done it and I just never envisaged us doing it ourselves because I thought we’d never be able to afford it. We just love the haulage industry and that is our passion so it would be daft for us not to carry on with that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31387941.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Britains-most-glam-lorry-driver-buys-own-haulage-firm-with-cash-made-from-sexy-pictures.jpg><p>Ben and Nicolle plan to grow the business gradually and in five years they hope to have at least two or three trucks, their own yard and maybe a couple of drivers.</p><p>And with <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Christmas</a> approaching, the couple insisted that it will look like any other December, despite their new found fortune.</p><p>Nicolle said: “It is still work work work but no matter how successful we are, we are very grounded. We are good for saving and we don’t spend money on ridiculous things so Christmases all look the same. We are grounded and are just focused on business.”</p><p><b><i>Want all the biggest Lifestyle news straight to your inbox? <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Sign up for our free Daily Star Hot Topics newsletter</a>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGihnWKvs7XTmqCnq12cuaK5zJ6qrWWcpL%2BzxYydqaKulad6dH2ScWdwaWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./china-stock-market.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>China stock market: Latest News and Updates</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./malika-kinison-bio-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Malika Kinison Bio, Age, Net Worth 2022, Salary, Married, Husband, Height</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
