"And for some reason, we looked at each other and was like, ‘That’s a great tattoo.’"</p><p>Pete actually called up his "tattoo guy" and they got the ink done that night -- obviously before coming down from their high. Only now, Miley is flying solo with "We babies," something she learned from watching his Smart Water ad.</p><p>In the commercial, Pete is seen getting some of his tattoos removed. "I’m like, Wait a minute, that’s right where ‘We babies’ was," Miley noted.

"I loved it," Pete declared. "I felt like the coolest guy ever."</p><p>He was also pretty popular, according to Miley, and with one guy in particular. As it turns out, while Pete was just hanging out with a drink in his hand, another guy was hanging out, too, but in a whole different way.</p><p>"I was just, you know, sitting there," Pete explained. "And for, like, I guess 20 minutes, this guys d--- was just, like, on my shoulder." After a beat, he added, "Yeah, I had a bruise the next day."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:68c73a0b-07e9-4b3d-aeee-17cc445a13d5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:f4c1cbb4-003b-481a-a21f-764fa9f67390 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/5by4/2021/12/09/330f8c95fb7b422e84b0c70cada09470_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">The Kelly Clarkson Show</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Watch This Delightfully Chaotic Sandra Bullock-Kelly Clarkson Interview Go Off the Rails</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Honestly, we've no idea how the gay club story didn't make it into this game, but what an absolute hoot it was trying to discern alongside the other two whether each statement was a lie or the truth.</p><p>The premise of the game is just that simple, with Miley, Jimmy and Pete taking turns reading a prepared statement. It is either true or false, and through questions and interrogation, the other two have to decide whether they believe it or not.</p><p>Miley's statement was, "One time Flavor Flav introduced me to a group of people as Gwen Stefani."

Pete wasn't buying this at all, though. "There’s no way you’re not out at two in the morning getting a nice Big Mac," he said.</p><p>As for Pete, his statement was much more succinct. "I got caught by the cops while smoking my first joint." But is it true? Miley was skeptical as Pete offered more details.</p><p>"There’s no way you remember," she argued. "You smoke a lot of weed. You don’t remember this story in this much detail."</p><p>Check out the video above to see which was which, and if anyone got it right.</p><p>Pete and Miley join forces for "Miley's New Year's Eve Party" starting at 10:30 p.m. ET on NBC. Explaining that they're going to Miami because she hates the cold, Miley described their strategy as, "He’ll be funny, I’ll be naked and together we’ve got a show."</p><p>Finally, Miley weighed in on Pete's nascent romance with Kim Kardashian, climbing right up on him to very pointedly sing "It Should Have Been Me." She even changed the lyrics to make it very clear that she's telling him it should have been her instead of Kim!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGtmamhforatsdhmmrKqpah6sbHTnmSdmaaesbS7zWaemrFdmLm2ro4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-band-perry-better-dig-two.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Band Perry, Better Dig Two Song Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-motel-sits-abandoned-north-carolina-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inside North Carolina's abandoned Family Inn Motel</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
