Kim Go Eun takes on the titular role of Yumi, a regular woman struggling with her feelings and doesn’t know how to express them well.&nbsp;</p><p>GOT7's Jinyoung portrays her charming co-worker, Yoo Babi in&nbsp;seasons one and two. Ahn Bo Hyun played the role of Goo Woong Yumi’s boyfriend and an entrepreneur working in a gaming startup company. While the first season of the series primarily delved into Yumi's love story with Goo Woong, the second season centers on her romantic journey with Yoo Babi. Fans are eagerly anticipating a potential season 3, but as of now, there hasn't been an official announcement regarding its production.</p><p>Kim Go Eun is presently involved in the filming of her upcoming film titled Love in the Big City (temporary title). GOT7’s Jinyoung began his military service earlier this year, enlisting in May.
