Within the conversation, she said something like, 'And then, at the end of it, he asked me if we could still be friends.' She got so fired up; she’s like, 'Who thinks that that’s ever a good idea?' She started flipping out about it."</p><p><strong>Watch Brett Young Perform "In Case You Didn't Know" for RISERS</strong></p><p>Her words struck inspiration with Young, who couldn't wait to get back to the writing session. They used Lee's story as the jumping off point for the "Like I Loved You" lyrics in the chorus, writing, "Don’t tell me we could still be friends / Hang out on the weekends / You’re gonna be OK if I start seeing somebody new, you hope that I do / It won’t be long / Til I forget to call every time that I’m drinking / And you ain’t the love song that I can’t keep from singing / I gotta be honest if you really believe that’s the truth / You never loved me like I loved you."</p><p>Young recalls that once they had a strong idea, the "Like I Loved You" lyrics and melody happened fast, but that's nothing unusual, he adds.</p><p>"Once you identify exactly what it is you want to say, it falls out fast. It’s figuring out what you want to say that takes a while," he observes. "Once I heard her story and I was able to go back in my history and find a good experience of mine that I felt like attached to hers, we went back and we wrote it really quick."</p><p>Young recently released "Like I Loved You" as the third single from his self-titled debut album. He's already scored huge hits with "<a href=#>Sleep Without You</a>" and &nbsp;"<a href=#>In Case You Didn’t Know</a>," which&nbsp;<a href=#>earned Young certification&nbsp;</a>as the first song released from a country artist to reach Platinum status in 2017. ToC named him one of our&nbsp;<a href=#>RISERS</a>&nbsp;for 2017, and we recently revealed his stunningly emotional&nbsp;<a href=#>cover of “Hallelujah”</a>&nbsp;from the RISERS shoot, which has received more than a million views in just over a week.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Get More Information on Brett Young and RISERS</a><p><strong>We Promise You’ve Never Seen a Cover Quite Like This!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6qVqcFuxc6upaBlnJ64pnnIZqOorpWZerq71GajsqqZmMBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-washing-machine-heart-by-mitski-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of Washing Machine Heart by Mitski</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alexandra-krosney-age-height-net-worth-dating-affairs-boyfriend-bio.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alexandra Krosney Age, Height, Net Worth, Dating, Affairs, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
