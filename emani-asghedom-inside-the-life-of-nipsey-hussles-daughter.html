On March 31, 2019, at approximately 3:18 p.m., Emani’s father, Nipsey Hussle, was fatally shot ten times in the parking lot of his store, Marathon Clothing, in South Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident injured three other individuals, and officials immediately rushed the victims to the hospital. Sadly, Emani’s father was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. Disturbingly, there are indications from pre-existing photographs that she may have witnessed the shooting as she was with her father. While this isn’t the only nerve-racking occurrence in Emani’s life, she still shines bright.</p><p>Here’s a look at her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-04_11-26-36-fotor-20230904113644-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Emani_Asghedom></span>Who Is Emani Asghedom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Emani Asghedom was born in the United States on November 9, 2008. She is a well-known American teenager and celebrity figure from Los Angeles, California. She gained prominence as the daughter of Tanisha Foster and Nipsey Hussle, a talented American rapper and songwriter. However, Emani’s parents didn’t stay together for long as many hoped.&nbsp;</p><p>Nipsey and Foster split in 2013 and subsequently engaged in a messy custody battle over their daughter. After Nipsey’s breakup with Foster, he started dating famous actress Lauren London, with whom he had a son, Kross Asghedom. Emani’s half-brother, Kross, was born in Los Angeles, California, on August 31, 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-04_11-26-16-fotor-20230904113739-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Got_Custody_of_Emani_Asghedom_After_Her_Fathers_Death></span>Who Got Custody of Emani Asghedom After Her Father’s Death?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following her father’s tragic death, a series of events unfolded in the celebrity child’s life. Initially, Emani Asghedom’s mother had joint custody with Nispsey Hussle. But after his death, concerns arose about the safety of the environment she could provide for Emani. Consequently, a contentious custody battle ensued between Emani’s mother and her aunt, Samantha.&nbsp;</p><p>According to reports, Samantha had been a constant presence in Nipsey Hussle’s daughter’s life since childhood. Hence, after Nipsey’s tragic death, Samantha accused Foster of seeking custody to gain unfettered access to Emani’s inheritance. Although Foster vehemently denied these allegations, Emani Asghedom moved in with her aunt during the custody dispute.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the court granted custody of Emani Asghedom and control over her inheritance to Nipsey Hussle’s family. In addition, the court-appointed Samantha, along with Nipsey’s brother, Sam Asghedom, and mother, Angelique Smith, as guardians for Emani Asghedom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-04_11-26-23-fotor-2023090411363-819x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Emani_Asghedoms_Mother></span>Where Is Emani Asghedom’s Mother?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shortly after she lost the custody battle, Foster made allegations against the Asghedom-Smith family. She claimed they used their financial power and influence to manipulate Emani Asghedom and herself by withholding financial support and reducing visitation. She also added that the family favored Nipsey’s longtime girlfriend, <a href=#>Lauren London</a>, with whom he shared a son.&nbsp;</p><p>In a court filing, Foster stated that she had remained actively involved in her daughter’s life, spending nights with her, taking her to school, and fulfilling the responsibilities of a parent. She also expressed her dissatisfaction that the guardians, Nipsey’s family, refused to take her calls and that she had to communicate through a third party.&nbsp;</p><p>Although she lost custody of her daughter, Foster maintained that no circumstances or events would disqualify her as Emani’s sole parent. In addition, she pleaded with the court to terminate the existing guardianship arrangement to no avail. Despite the hassles in Emani’s life, she still finds a way to soar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-04_11-26-43-fotor-20230904113853.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will Emani Asghedom Follow in Her Father’s Footsteps?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While it is unknown if the celebrity kid will become a renowned singer like her father, she is a born star. Emani Asghedom has garnered significant attention on social media with her impressive singing abilities. In October 2021, a video shared on <a href=#>Instagram </a>by The Shade Room showcased the late rapper’s daughter performing a cover of Whitney Houston’s iconic song, “I Will Always Love You.”</p><p>Originally posted by a family member, the clip captured Emani Asghedom hesitantly saying, “I can’t do it.” However, an off-camera voice encouraged the then-twelve-year-old, who then showcased her remarkable vocal talent. Given her lineage as the daughter of a rapper, Emani’s skill with a microphone doesn’t come as a surprise. Also, the video received over three million views.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to her singing talent, Emani Asghedom is a talented dancer. The celebrity child showcased her impressive dance skills in a TikTok video, dancing to the viral sound “I Like.” Social media users praised her dance moves in the comments section and remarked on her striking resemblance to her father.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Emani_Asghedoms_Net_Worth></span>What Is Emani Asghedom’s Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Emani Asghedom does not have a career yet, the celebrity kid has amassed incredible wealth from her father’s fortune. Before his death, Nipsey Hussle had a net worth of around $8 million, comprising annual income, royalties, and property.</p><p>His wealth included valuable assets such as gold necklaces, earrings, two Rolex watches, and a princess-cut diamond. Following his death, legal documents revealed that Emani Asghedom would receive half of her late father’s estate.&nbsp;</p><p>However, to ensure the responsible management and investment of her wealth until she reached the age of eighteen, the court-appointed her family as executors of her estate. Despite the odds, Emani Asghedom is growing to be a woman her father would be proud of.</p><p>Like Emani, <a href=#>John Travolta’s daughter, Ella Bleu</a> has grown into a fantastic model with many other talents despite her tragic childhood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksq6tzaJkmquXnbKlu8xmoKermZmybsDHnmSloZaaerCyjKegqauVrnqpwdKso56rXZmutrPHrZyrZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rockridge-softball-wins-sectional-game-6-1.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rockridge Softball wins Sectional game 6-1</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./431907-50-cutest-sorority-recruitment-captions-instagram-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>50+ cutest sorority recruitment captions for Instagram photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
