From 5-3 down, Slessor won two frames on the spin, but O'Donnell held his nerve in the 11th frame. Despite running his opponent close, Slessor slammed his own performance.</p><p>“I was useless,” he told Eurosport. “He deserved his win. I could not find the top cushion all day and missed silly balls. He made a good break at the end.</p><p>“I thought I found a gear to go 5-5 and all I was looking for was a chance, I thought I was playing a decent safety and I put the red over the hole. To be fair, he made a great break so good luck to him.”</p><p>It was the third time Slessor had come up short in semi-finals. He added: "I have lost a couple of these close semis now and have not really played great. I had more than enough chances and I did not take them and Martin deserved his win.</p><p>“I have played some decent stuff during the week, there are some positives, but I am just distraught with how I played today.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8GrnJqjmaO0brPAq7Bmr5mhwLC6jGprcGWSp7Kit4xsaWptYWeEcw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jewish-teacher-kanye-wests-california-private-school-resigns-hours-dumped-adidas-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jewish teacher at Kanye West's California private school RESIGNS hours before he is dumped by Adidas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marie-osmond-is-a-huge-fan-of-sharon-osbournes-new-look.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>ExclusiveMarie Osmond Is a Huge Fan of Sharon Osbournes New Look: She Looks Wonderful</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
