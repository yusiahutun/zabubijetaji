While talking about Karen Malina White, an American television and film actress who has contributed over three decades of her life to the showbiz; one of the&nbsp;frequently asked questions about her by her followers is, "Is she married?"Since her ex-beau has already moved on from their relationship and now has a family alongside, people are curious to know where Karen stands in her relationship status.&nbsp;<p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-179 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>While talking about Karen Malina White, an American television and film actress who has contributed over three decades of her life to the showbiz; one of the&nbsp;frequently asked questions about her by her followers is, "Is she married?"</p><p>Since her ex-beau has already moved on from their relationship and now has a family alongside, people are curious to know where Karen stands in her relationship status.&nbsp;</p><p>So do read along as we've summed up all about that, just for you!&nbsp;</p><h2>Relationship Update On Karen Malina White</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Karen Malina White, best known for her&nbsp;role as Charmaine Brown in the American television sitcom, "The Cosby Show," has been able to create a fan base of her own, and those admirers are very much interested in knowing about her life.</p><p>Well, Karen at the age of 52,&nbsp;who enjoys the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $1 Million, has stayed mysterious for the most parts of her life, so very few details about her personal life have come forth. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Although Karen has not yet married anyone, she was in a relationship once. Karen was previously<a href=# rel=follow>&nbsp;involved romantically with&nbsp;Malcolm-Jamal Warner back in 2000.&nbsp;</a></p><p>She shared over seven years of her life with Malcolm; during that course, the couple was even rumored to have gotten married. But that was just a made up story,&nbsp;as back then, Karen gave a statement contradicting the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumors </a>of&nbsp;Malcolm being her husband. She stated,</p><p>"I'm not married. People probably started saying that because we were in a relationship for seven and a half years."</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Well, even after sharing such extended togetherness, unfortunately, the couple did not make it to the wedding.&nbsp;Karen and Malcolm parted their ways in 2007 after clearing things up with each other.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Karen Malina White with Malcolm-Jamar Warner </strong>(Photo: whosdateswho.com) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Since then, Karen has not been spotted with any other man or is linked with any of her fellow cast members. She seems to have kept romance at a distance from herself after heartbreak.</p><p>However, her former boyfriend Malcolm has his name linked with many ladies along the line. Before Malcolm met Karen, he was involved in a romantic relationship with&nbsp;Michelle Thomas back in 1988. The duo shared the sets together in “The Cosby Show”&nbsp;but split after ten years of relationship back in 1998.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly,&nbsp;reports suggest that&nbsp;he was married to&nbsp;Tracee Ellis Ross, an American actress who is also a TV host. But things did not work between them as well and resulted in their divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing about their relationship has surfaced the media, except for the Instagram <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post </a>from Malcolm stating about the "good relationship" they share.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Furthermore, he was also in a relationship with Regina King back in 2011, and rumors had it that the duo ended their relationship after two years of togetherness back in 2013. But nothing about them has been known since then. Moreover, Karen's ex-beau, Malcolm is now <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blessed </a>with a baby and has a family now. &nbsp;</p><p>While Karen's former boyfriend enjoys the family life, Karen is blessed with a daughter. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shares</a>&nbsp;the child with her ex-boyfriend but&nbsp;has not mentioned any further details about her daughter, and it remains unclear if she shared the daughter with Malcolm or another lover.</p><p>Think we're missing something?
