It’s worth mentioning that if you solve all Merlin Trials in Hogwarts Legacy, you unlock Merlin’s Beard!&nbsp;Trophy/Achievement.</p><p>But, before looking for the Trials, you must complete the&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Trials Of Merlin&nbsp;main quest</a> and learn everything you need to know about the activity. The key to starting any Trial is the Mallowsweet Leaves, which can be found in the open world and even grown at a potting table in the Room of Requirement. For the second method of obtaining Mallowsweet Leaves, which is also the best, you’ll need to buy the Mallowsweet Seed Recipe from The Magic Neep shop in the Hogsmeade village.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Where_To_Find_All_Feldcroft_Region_Merlin_Trials_in_Hogwarts_Legacy>Where To Find All Feldcroft Region Merlin Trials in Hogwarts Legacy</span></h2><p>As you can see on the map below, the Feldcroft Region Merlin Trials are scattered all over the area, mainly on the western side. It’s important to know that if you get close to a Trial’s altar, its icon appears on your map, meaning you can track it for the exact location.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-locations-map-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_1_In_a_Medium_Bandit_Camp>Merlin Trial #1: In a Medium Bandit Camp</span></h3><p>The first Merlin Trial is in a Medium Bandit Camp southwest of the West Hogwarts Valley Floo Flame. The fastest way to get to the Trial’s altar is to fast travel to the Floo Flame, then get on your Broom and gain some serious altitude to reach the top of the mountain southwest, where you should see the Bandit Camp. Look for the altar near some stairs in the southwestern part of the camp.</p><p>Now start the Trial and look around the altar for five stones highlighted in blue if you cast Revelio, just like in the following image. To complete the Trial, you must destroy the rocks using the Confringo spell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-locations-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_2_In_a_Small_Bandit_Camp>Merlin Trial #2: In a Small Bandit Camp</span></h3><p>For the second Feldcroft Merlin Trial, you must go to the Small Bandit Camp northeast of the North Feldcroft Floo Flame. There is also one of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Feldcroft Region Ancient Magic Hotspots</a> nearby if you want to check it out. Once you reach the location of Trial #2, interact with the altar and cast Revelio to highlight three stones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-puzzles-solutions-1024x576.jpg><p>These stones are different from the ones in Trial #1 because they are made of two parts. To complete the second Trial, you have to flip the top parts of the stones so that the drawings on them match the ones on the bottom pieces. You need to use the Flipendo spell to complete the task. Remember that the stones get flipped differently depending on your position toward them.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_3_West_of_the_North_Feldcroft_Floo_Flame>Merlin Trial #3: West of the North Feldcroft Floo Flame</span></h3><p>The next Merlin Trial is in the first Small Bandit Camp west of the North Feldcroft Floo Flame. After starting the Trial, go up the stairs to the southeast, then jump from stone to stone to solve the puzzle. On the second stone, you can see some barrels you must destroy with basic attacks to continue. Reach the fifth stone without touching the ground, and you complete the Trial.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-puzzles-locations-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_4_On_the_Edge_of_a_Cliff>Merlin Trial #4: On the Edge of a Cliff</span></h3><p>The fourth Trial is on the edge of a cliff west of the previous puzzle. Don’t forget to check your map for the Merlin Trial icon if you have problems finding the altar. Upon starting the Trial, cast Revelio and look closely for five stones highlighted in blue that you must destroy with the Confringo spell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-complete-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_5_By_the_Water>Merlin Trial #5: By the Water</span></h3><p>The fifth Merlin puzzle is found by the water north of Rookwood Castle. When you reach the spot, start the Trial and look around for nine balls you must destroy with basic attacks. Each ball stands on a small pillar, and you can spot them more easily if you cast Revelio. The balls are split into three groups of three, one close to the southeast of the altar, another uphill southwest, and the last across the water to the west.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-complete-all-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_6_On_the_Coast>Merlin Trial #6: On the Coast</span></h3><p>Another Merlin Altar in the Feldcroft Region is on the coast, southwest of the previous altar, at the sixth location marked on our map. Find the altar and start the Trial for which you’ll have to light three torches using Confringo. After you light the first torch, you have a short time to light the other two, so move fast.</p><p>Also, I suggest you start with the tallest torch and work your way to the smallest. You can see one torch east of the altar, another southeast, and the last southwest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-complete-all-16-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_7_Northwest_of_the_Rookwood_Castle_Floo_Flame>Merlin Trial #7: Northwest of the Rookwood Castle Floo Flame</span></h3><p>The seventh Hogwarts Legacy Merlin Trial in the Feldcroft Region is southwest of Trial #6 or northwest of the Rookwood Castle Floo Flame. Once you start the Trial, you must turn west of the altar and go near the edge to spot four stones in the water. Jump from stone to stone to solve the puzzle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-solve-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_8_Northeast_of_Rookwood_Castle>Merlin Trial #8: Northeast of Rookwood Castle</span></h3><p>For the next Trial, you must go northeast of Rookwood Castle, at the eighth location pinpointed on the map above. This time, you must rebuild three stone statues close to the altar. Cast Revelio to see the remains highlighted in blue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-solve-all-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><p>One statue can be rebuilt on the rock northeast of the altar by casting Reparo while aiming at the remains. Do the same for the statue northwest of the altar and the one to the north.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_9_Behind_a_Big_Rock>Merlin Trial #9: Behind a Big Rock</span></h3><p>Now, head southeast of the Feldcroft village to reach the ninth altar and interact with it. The altar is behind a big rock, and if you have problems finding it, check your map because you might have passed close to the Trial, revealing its icon. To solve the puzzle, you have to destroy nine balls with basic attacks; you can see all of them if you look northeast of the altar and cast Revelio, as shown in the following screenshot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-solve-all-16-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_10_Northwest_of_the_South_Feldcroft_Floo_Flame>Merlin Trial #10: Northwest of the South Feldcroft Floo Flame</span></h3><p>The tenth Merlin puzzle available in the Feldcroft Region will take you northwest of the South Feldcroft Floo Flame. To solve this puzzle, you must use Confringo to destroy the five stones highlighted in blue when casting Revelio. Don’t forget that Revelio allows you to see the rocks even through objects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-solve-all-16-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-puzzles-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_11_Next_to_the_Water>Merlin Trial #11: Next to the Water</span></h3><p>For another Feldcroft Merlin Trial, head southeast of the South Feldcroft Floo Flame, and you’ll find the altar next to the water. Upon interacting with the altar, go northeast to see a hole in the ground, then go uphill on your Broom, and you’ll spot a boulder high on the edge of a cliff on the left side. To complete the Trial, you must use Depulso to guide the boulder to the hole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-solve-all-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-puzzles-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_12_North_of_the_Feldcroft_Catacomb_Floo_Flame>Merlin Trial #12: North of the Feldcroft Catacomb Floo Flame</span></h3><p>The following side activity is located a short distance north of the Feldcroft Catacomb Floo Flame, fairly close to one of the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel=follow>Feldcroft Region Balloons sets</a>. Trial #12 requires you to destroy another five stones with the Confringo spell. Cast Revelio to spot the stones while scouting the area. Two stones are southwest of the altar, one east, another northeast, and the last on a big rock northwest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-solve-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-puzzles-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_13_Next_to_Some_Ruins>Merlin Trial #13: Next to Some Ruins</span></h3><p>The thirteenth puzzle can be solved next to some ruins east of the Feldcroft Catacomb Floo Flame. Interact with the altar at the thirteenth location marked on our map and look for three stones with diamond-shaped holes. To solve the puzzle, you must find three groups of green fireflies and bring them to the stones. To make the fireflies follow you, cast Lumos near them.</p><p>The stones are really close to the altar, one to the east, another southeast, and the last southwest. As for the fireflies, you have to go a little further; one group is on a cliff southwest of the altar, another downhill south, and the last is high on the mountain northeast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/where-to-find-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_14_In_Another_Small_Bandit_Camp>Merlin Trial #14: In Another Small Bandit Camp</span></h3><p>For the next challenge, you must head to the Small Bandit Camp northeast of the previous altar. Go ahead and start the Trial, then look for yet another five stones you must destroy with the Confringo spell. I recommend getting on your Broom, flying a little to the southwest of the altar, and casting Revelio to spot all five stones, like in the following image.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/where-to-find-all-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_15_Next_to_a_River>Merlin Trial #15: Next to a River</span></h3><p>Merlin Trial #15 will take you west of Irondale. Look for the altar next to the river at the said location, then start the Trial. Next, you have to quickly light three torches using Confringo. You’ll find one torch behind the stone bridge northeast of the altar, another west, and the last on a rock in the river southeast. First, light the tallest torch and end with the smallest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/where-to-find-all-16-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Merlin_Trial_16_Next_to_a_Scarecrow>Merlin Trial #16: Next to a Scarecrow</span></h3><p>The last Merlin Trial in the Feldcroft area can be completed right in Irondale, and you’ll find the altar next to a scarecrow northwest of the hamlet’s Floo Flame. This time, you need to destroy nine balls using basic attacks. Like in the fifth Trial, the balls are split into three groups of three. One group is next to the house south of the altar, another uphill northwest, and the last on the stone fence east.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gameclubz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-find-all-hogwarts-legacy-feldcroft-region-merlin-trials-1024x576.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3MnpqlrZKve6S7zGifqJ%2Bnlr%2B1v4ylnKCZk656p7HLnZqrp5aperOxxqKmp2Wdmr%2Bttc1mq6uhkaHAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-get-mermaid-waves.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Get Mermaid Waves</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sprite-zero-nutrition-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>18 Sprite Zero Nutrition Facts of this Refreshing Beverage</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1-651-lake-j-day-1-sliding-rock.html>#1,651 Lake J Day 1 + Sliding Rock.
