Instead, he just had a really deep bone bruise. They had to pull out 45 cc of blood.”</p><p>Travis was a guest&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>on “The Pat McAfee Show”</a>&nbsp;this January 31, 2024, where he revealed that he “threw the ball in her court” and that he had asked her to go see his game against the Chicago Bears on September 24, 2023. He cleared up the speculation of when they exactly met by stating that Taylor and him “had known each other” for almost “a month up to that point” when she attended the game. Taylor has become the Chiefs number one fan and has been to 12 games in support of Travis. “I love it when Taylor comes and supports me&nbsp;and enjoys the game with the fam and friends.”</p><p>A source told Entertainment Tonight about the state of the relationship. <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-planning-to-spend-more-time-at-travis-kelces-kansas-city-house-during-tour-break rel=nofollow>“Things between Travis and Taylor are going really well,”</a> the source said. “Their relationship is progressing in a great way. Taylor is planning to spend a lot more time at Travis’ house in Kansas City while she is on a break from touring.”</p><p>“They’re both very excited to be together, and Travis is making sure that Taylor feels comfortable and at home,” they continued. “They have mutual respect and admiration for one another, and their feelings for each other are sincere.” In the her Time Person of The Year interview Taylor revealed that “This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” and they pretty much “started hanging out right after that.” Taylor expressed how grateful she was that they “had a significant amount of time that no one knew” and that allowed them “to get to know each other.”</p><p>According to an insider who spoke to DailyMail, Kelce is actively brainstorming ideas for a “unique” ring for a future proposal. When it comes to Taylor, he loves her and sees a future with her and has thought about what a ring for her would be like as well. Apparently, Kelce’s special plans include incorporating diamonds from his two Super Bowl rings into Taylor’s future engagement ring. Beyond diamonds, Kelce also wants the ring to have a special engraving.&nbsp;The insider explained, “He wants to make sure it isn’t something cheesy, but more unique and something that is a part of him that he shares with her to show that forever means forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbq7Osp2roZWjsXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christmas-podcasts-to-get-christmas-spirit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>12 Christmas Podcasts to Get You in the Christmas Spirit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katie-pavlich-net-worth-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is American Commentator-Katie Pavlich Net Worth?
